<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This book has been prepared, particularly, for the
use of the Freshman Class in Harvard College. The
author has, at the same time, desired to meet the
need, felt in our high schools, of a manual of Moral
Science fitted for the more advanced classes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the preparation of this treatise, the author has
been at no pains to avoid saying what others had said
before. Yet the book is original, so far as such a
book can be or ought to be original. The author has
directly copied nothing except Dugald Stewart's
classification of the Desires. But as his reading for
several years has been principally in the department
of ethics, it is highly probable that much of what he
supposes to be his own thought may have been derived
from other minds. Of course, there is no small
part of the contents of a work of this kind, which is
the common property of writers, and must in some
form reappear in every elementary manual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Should this work be favorably received, the author
hopes to prepare, for higher college-classes, a textbook,
embracing a more detailed and thorough discussion
of the questions at issue among the different
schools—past and present—of ethical science.

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">Action.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An act or action is a voluntary exercise of any
power of body or mind. The character of an
action, whether good or bad, depends on the intention
of the agent. Thus, if I mean to do my neighbor a
kindness by any particular act, the action is kind, and
therefore good, on my part, even though he derive
no benefit from it, or be injured by it. If I mean to
do my neighbor an injury, the action is unkind, and
therefore bad, though it do him no harm, or though
it even result to his benefit. If I mean to perform
an action, good or bad, and am prevented from performing
it by some unforeseen hindrance, the act is
as truly mine as if I had performed it. Words which
have any meaning are actions. So are thoughts which
we purposely call up, or retain in the mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, the actions which we are
compelled to perform against our wishes, and the
thoughts which are forced upon our minds, without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our own consent, are not our actions. This is obviously
true when our fellow-men forcibly compel us
to do or to hear things which we do not wish to do
or to hear. It is their action solely, and we have no
more part in it than if we were brute beasts, or inanimate
objects. It is, then, the intention that gives
character to the action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That we commonly do what we intend to do there
can be no doubt. We do not act under <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate</span></span>
compulsion. We are, therefore, free <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">agents</span></span>, or actors.
But are our intentions free? Is it in our power to
will otherwise than we will? When we choose to
perform an act that is just or kind, is it in our power
to choose to perform an act of the opposite character?
In other words, is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span> free? If it be not so, then
what we call our intentions are not ours, but are to
be attributed to the superior will which has given
direction to our wills. If God has so arranged the
order of nature and the course of events as to force
my will in certain directions, good or evil, then it is
He that does the good or evil which I seem to do.
On this supposition God is the only agent or actor in
the universe. Evil, if it be wrought, is wrought by
Him alone; and if we cannot admit that the Supreme
Being does evil, the only alternative is to deny the
existence of evil, and to maintain that what we call
evil bears an essential part in the production of good.
For instance, if the horrible enormities imputed to
Nero were utterly bad, the evil that was in them is
chargeable, not on Nero, but on God; or if it be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
maintained that God cannot do evil, then Nero was
an instrument for the advancement of human happiness
and well-being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What reasons have we for believing that the
human will is free?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. We have the direct evidence of consciousness.
We are distinctly conscious, not only of doing
as we choose, but of exercising our free choice among
different objects of desire, between immediate and
future enjoyment, between good and evil. Now,
though consciousness may sometimes deceive us, it is
the strongest evidence that we can have; we are so
constituted that we cannot refuse our credence to it;
and our belief in it lies at the basis of all evidence
and of all knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. We are clearly conscious of merit or demerit,
of self-approval or self-condemnation, in consequence
of our actions. If our wills were acted upon by a
force beyond our control, we might congratulate or
pity ourselves, but we could not praise or blame ourselves,
for what we had done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. We praise or blame others for their good or
evil actions; and in our conduct toward them we
show that we believe them to have been not merely
fortunate or unfortunate, but praiseworthy or blameworthy.
So far as we suppose their wills to have
been influenced by circumstances beyond their control,
we regard them with diminished approval or
censure. On the other hand, we give the highest
praise to those who have chosen the good amidst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strong temptations to evil, and bestow the severest
censure on those who have done evil with virtuous surroundings
and influences. Now our judgment of others
must of necessity be derived from our own consciousness,
and if we regard and treat them as freely willing
beings, it can only be because we know that our
own wills are free.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These arguments, all derived from consciousness,
can be directly met only by denying the validity
of consciousness as a ground of belief. The opposing
arguments are drawn from sources independent of
consciousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The most obvious objection to the freedom of
the human will is derived from the power of motives.
It is said, We never act without a motive;
we always yield to the strongest motive; and motives
are not of our own creation or choice, but are
brought to bear upon us independently of our own
action. There has been, from the creation until now,
an unbroken series of causes and effects, and we can
trace every human volition to some anterior cause or
causes belonging to this inevitable series, so that, in
order for the volition to have been other than it was,
some member of this series must have been displaced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this it may be answered:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) We are capable of acting without a motive,
and we do so act in numberless instances. It
was a common saying among the Schoolmen, that an
ass, at equal distances from two equal bundles of hay,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would starve to death for lack of a motive to choose
either. But have we any motive whatever in the
many cases in which we choose—sometimes after the
vain endeavor to discover a ground of preference—between
two equally valuable, beautiful, or appetizing
objects, between two equally pleasant routes to the
same terminus, or between two equally agreeable
modes of passing a leisure day or hour? Yet this
choice, made without motive, may be a fruitful cause
of motives that shall have a large influence in the
future. Thus, on the route which one chooses without
any assignable reason, he may encounter persons
or events that shall modify his whole plan of life.
The instances are by no means few, in which the
most decisive results have ensued upon a choice thus
made entirely without motive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Motives of equal strength act differently on
different temperaments. The same motive, when it
stands alone, with no opposing motive, has not the
same effect on different minds. There is in the will
of every human being a certain reluctance to action—in
some greater, in others less—corresponding to
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis inertiæ</span></span> in inanimate substances; and as the
impulse which will move a wooden ball may not suffice
to move a leaden ball, so the motive which will
start into action a quick and sensitive temperament,
may produce no effect on a person of more sluggish
nature. Thus, among men utterly destitute of honesty,
some are tempted by the most paltry opportunities
for theft or fraud; others, not one whit more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scrupulous, have their cupidity aroused only by the
prospect of some substantial gain. So, too, some sincerely
benevolent persons are moved to charitable
actions by the slightest needs and sufferings; others,
equally kind and generous, have their sympathies
excited only on grave occasions and by imperative
claims. Motives, then, have not a determinate and
calculable strength, but a power which varies with
the previous character of the person to whom they
are addressed. Moreover, the greater or less susceptibility
to motives from without is not a difference
produced by education or surroundings; for it may
be traced in children from the earliest development of
character. Nor can it be hereditary; for it may be
found among children of the same parents, and not
infrequently between twins nurtured under precisely
the same care, instruction, and discipline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) External motives are not the causes of
action, but merely its occasions or opportunities.
The cause of the action already exists in the character
of the agent, before the motive presents itself. A
purse of gold that may be stolen without detection is
an irresistible motive to a thief, or to a person who,
though not previously a thief, is covetous and unprincipled;
but the same purse might lie in the way of
an honest man every day for a month, and it would
not make him a thief. If I recognize the presence of
a motive, I must perform some action, whether exterior
or internal; but whether that action will be in
accordance with the motive, or in the opposite direction,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is determined by my previous character and
habits of action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) The objection which we are considering assumes,
without sufficient reason, that the phenomena
of human action are closely analogous to
those of motion in the material world. The analogy
fails in several particulars. No material object
can act on itself and change its own nature, adaptations,
or uses, without any external cause; but the human
mind can act upon itself without any external
cause, as in repentance, serious reflection, religious
purposes and aims. Then again, if two or more
forces in different directions act upon a material object,
its motion is not in the direction of either, or
with the momentum derived from either, but in a direction
and with a momentum resulting from the composition
of these forces; whereas the human will, in
the presence of two or more motives, pursues the
direction and yields to the force of but one of those
motives. We are not, then, authorized to reason
about the power of motives from the action of material
forces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) Were the arguments against the freedom of
the will logically sound and unanswerable, they would
be of no avail against the testimony of consciousness.
Axioms, intuitive beliefs, and truths of consciousness
can be neither proved nor disproved by
reasoning; and the reasoning by which they seem to
be disproved only evinces that they are beyond the
range and reach of argument. Thus it may be maintained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with show of reason that motion is impossible;
for an object cannot move where it is, and cannot
move where it is not,—a dilemma which does not
disprove the reality of motion, but simply indicates
that the reality of motion, being an intuitive belief,
neither needs nor admits logical proof.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It is urged against the freedom of the human
will that it is inconsistent with God's foreknowledge
of future events, and thus represents the Supreme
Being as not omniscient, and in that particular
finite and imperfect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this objection we reply:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) If human freedom and the Divine foreknowledge
of human acts are mutually incompatible, we
must still retain the freedom of the will as a truth
of consciousness; for if we discredit our own consciousness,
we cannot trust even the act of the understanding
by which we set it aside, which act we know
by the testimony of consciousness alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) If the acts of a freely willing being cannot be
foreknown, the ignorance of them does not detract
from the perfectness of the Supreme Being. Omnipotence
cannot make two and two five. Omnipotence
cannot do what is intrinsically impossible. No more
can Omniscience know what is intrinsically unknowable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) If God's foreknowledge is entire, it must
include his own acts, no less than those of men.
If his foreknowledge of men's acts is incompatible
with their freedom, then his foreknowledge of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
own acts is incompatible with his own freedom. We
have, therefore, on the theory of necessity, instead of
a Supreme Will on the throne of the universe, mere
fate or destiny. This is equivalent to the denial of a
personal God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) It cannot be proved that God's foreknowledge
and man's free will are incompatible with
each other. The most that we can say is that we
do not fully see how they are to be reconciled, which
is the case with many pairs of undoubted truths that
might be named. But while a perfect explanation of
the harmony of the Divine foreknowledge and human
freedom is beyond the scope of our faculties, we may
explain it in part, from our own experience. Human
foreknowledge extends very far and with a great degree
of certainty, without abridging the freedom of
those to whom it relates. When we can foresee outward
events, we can often foretell, with little danger
of mistake, the courses of conduct to which they will
give rise. In view of the extent and accuracy of human
foresight, we cannot pronounce it impossible,
that He who possesses antecedent knowledge of the
native constitution of every human being, and of the
shaping circumstances and influences to which each
being is subjected, may foreknow men's acts, even
though their wills be entirely free.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are certain elements of the human constitution,
in part natural, in part acquired, which
always prompt and urge men to action, without
reference to the good or evil there may be in the
action, and without reference to its ultimate effects
on the actor's well-being. These are the Appetites,
the Desires, and the Affections.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">The Appetites.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Appetites are cravings of the body, adapted,
and undoubtedly designed, to secure the continued
life of the individual and the preservation of the species.
They are common to man with the lower orders
of animals, with this difference, that in man they may
be controlled, directed, modified, in part suppressed,
while in brutes they are uncontrollable, and always
tend to the same modes of gratification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Appetite is intermittent. When gratified, it ceases
for a time, and is renewed for the same person nearly
at the same intervals, and under similar circumstances.
It is, while it lasts, an uneasy, even a painful sensation,
and therefore demands prompt relief, and leads
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to action with a view to such relief. It is also a characteristic
of appetite that its indulgence is attended,
not merely by relief, but by positive pleasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The appetites are essential to the well-being of
men, individually and collectively. Were it not for
the pain of hunger and thirst, and the pleasure of
gratifying them, both indolence and engrossing industry
would draw off the attention of men from their
bodily needs; nourishment would be taken irregularly,
and with little reference to quality; and one
would often become aware of his neglect only too late
to arrest its consequences. A similar remark applies
to the appetite designed to secure the preservation of
the species. But for this, it may be doubted whether
men would willingly take upon themselves the cares,
labors, responsibilities, and contingent disappointments
and sorrows involved in the rearing of children.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a life conformed to nature, hunger and thirst recur
only when the body actually needs the supply
which they crave. But stimulating food, by the
reaction that follows strong excitement of any portion
of the nervous system, may create hunger when
there is no need of food, and in like manner not only
intoxicating, but highly stimulating liquids, may occasion
an excessive, morbid, and injurious thirst.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Appetite is modified by habit. There is hardly
any substance so offensive that it may not by use become
agreeable, then an object of desire, and, at
length, of intense craving.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The craving for repose and that for muscular
action, though not classed among the appetites, have
all their characteristics, and serve similar ends in the
economy of human life. After a certain period of
activity, rest is felt as a bodily necessity, as food is,
after long fasting; and in like manner, when the
wearied muscles have had their due repose, there is
an irresistible tendency to their exercise, without reference
to any special employment or recreation. It
is by the alternation of these tendencies that the active
and industrious are saved from the ruinous consequences
of overtasked limbs or brain, and that the
indolent are urged to the reluctant activity without
which health and life itself would be sacrificed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The appetites, being mere bodily impulses, and being
all liable to excess or misdirection, need the control
of the will, and of the principles of action by
which the will is determined and regulated.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Desires are distinguished from the Appetites,
first, in their not originating from the body; secondly,
in their not being necessarily intermittent; and
thirdly, in their tendency to increase indefinitely, often
through the whole of life, and to gain strength by the
attainment of their specific objects. If classified by
their objects, they might seem too numerous to be
specified; but they may all be embraced under the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
titles of the Desire for Knowledge, for Society, for Esteem,
for Power, and for Superiority. These all may
be traced, in a more or less rudimentary form, in the
inferior animals. Many of these animals show an
active curiosity. Many are gregarious in their native
state, and most of the domestic animals delight in the
society of their kind; some take manifest pleasure in
human society; and the instances are by no means
rare, in which animals, by nature mutually hostile, become
strongly attached to each other, and render to
each other the most friendly services. The dog, the
horse, and the cat evidently crave the esteem of human
beings, and show tokens of genuine grief when
they incur rebuke or discern tokens of disapproval.
The dog maintains with watchful jealousy his own
authority in his own peculiar domain; and in the
chase or on the race-ground the dog and the horse are
as emulous of success as their masters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">1. The Desire of Knowledge.</span></span> This in the human
being is manifested with the earliest dawn of intelligence.
The infant is busy with eye and hand throughout
his waking hours; and that the desire of knowledge
is innate, and has no reference to the use that is
to be made of the things known, is manifest from the
rapid growth of knowledge in the first years of life,
before the child has any distinct conception of the
uses of objects, or any conscious capacity of employing
them for his own benefit. It may be doubted
whether in any subsequent year of life so much
knowledge is acquired as during the first year. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
child but a year old has learned the nature of the familiar
objects of the house and the street, the faces
and names of a large number of relatives, domestics,
and acquaintances, the regular succession of seasons
and events in daily domestic life, and the meanings of
most of the words that are addressed to him or employed
concerning him and the objects around him.
In more advanced life this desire grows by what it
feeds on, and never ceases to be active. It assumes,
indeed, different directions, in part determining, and
in part determined by, condition, profession, or employment.
Even in the most idle and frivolous, it is
strong, often intense, though its objects be worthless.
Such persons frequently are as sedulous in collecting
the paltry gossip of society as the naturalist in acquiring
the knowledge of new species of plants or
insects, and as ingenious in their inferences from what
they see and hear as the philosopher in his inductions
from the facts of science.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not only in infancy, but through life, knowledge
is sought evidently for its own sake, and not
merely for its uses. But a very small part of what
one knows can be made of practical utility as to his
own comfort or emolument. Many, indeed, voluntarily
sacrifice ease, gain, position, in the pursuit of
science or literature. Fame, if it accrues, is not unwelcome;
but by the higher order of minds fame is
not pursued as an end, and there are many departments
of knowledge in which little or no reputation
is to be attained. Then, too, it is not the learner,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but the teacher, not the profound scholar, merely, but
the able expositor, speaker, or writer, who can expect
a distinguished name; while there are many who content
themselves with acquiring knowledge, without
attempting publicity. Nor yet can benevolence account
for the love of knowledge. Many, indeed,
make their attainments the property of others, and
are zealous in diffusing their own scientific views, or
in dispensing instruction in their own departments.
But there are also many solitary, recluse students;
and it may be doubted whether, if a man who is
earnestly engaged in any intellectual pursuit were
shut out entirely from human society, and left alone
with his books or with nature, his diligence would be
relaxed, or his ardor abated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">2. The Desire of Society.</span></span> This, also, is manifested
so early as to show that it is an original, and
not an acquired principle. Little children dread solitude,
crave the presence of familiar faces, and evince
pleasure in the company of children of their own age.
A child, reared in comparative seclusion and silence,
however tenderly, suffers often in health, always in
mental vigor and elasticity; while in a large family,
and in intimate association with companions of his
own age, the individual child has the fullest and most
rapid development of all his powers. There is, indeed,
in the lives of many children, a period when
the presence of strangers is unwelcome; but this
state of feeling—seldom of long duration—can in
most instances be traced to some sudden fright, harsh
voice, or imagined neglect or unkindness.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The natural course of human life proves that man
is by the necessity of his nature a social being. The
young of other animals are at a very early period
emancipated and forsaken by their parents, while the
human child has many years of dependence, and is
hardly prepared to dispense with the shelter and kind
offices of his native home, when he is moved to create
a new home of his own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no pursuit in life in which a community of
interest fails to give added zest and energy. There
is no possible ground of association on which societies
are not formed, and the trivial, fictitious, or imaginary
pretences on which men thus combine, meet, and act
in concert, are manifest proofs of a social proclivity
so strong as to create reasons for its indulgence where
such reasons do not already exist. Even in science
and in the most abstruse forms of erudition, men of
learning seek mutual countenance and encouragement,
and readily suspend their solitary research and study
for the opportunity of intercommunication on the
subjects and objects of their pursuit. The cases in
which society is voluntarily shunned or forsaken are
as rare as the cases of congenital disease or deformity;
and for every such instance there may generally
be assigned some grave, if not sufficient, cause. Religious
asceticism has, indeed, induced many persons,
especially in the early Christian ages, to lead a solitary
life; but the cœnobites have always vastly outnumbered
the hermits; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monasteries</span></span> (solitary abodes)
have become <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">convents</span></span> (assemblages); and those who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are shut out from the rest of the world find comfort
in social devotion, in the common refectory, and in
those seasons of recreation when the law of silence is
suspended. For prisoners solitary confinement has
been found deleterious both to body and mind, and
this system, instituted with philanthropic purpose,
and commended on grounds that seemed intimately
connected with the reformation of the guilty, is now
generally repudiated as doing violence to human nature.
Even for the insane, society, with judicious
classification and restriction, is an essential part of
curative treatment, and the success of asylums, as
compared with the most skilful and humane private
treatment, is due in great part to the social element.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It cannot be maintained that the desire of society
results from fear, and from the felt need of mutual
protection; for it exists in full at the most fearless
periods of life, and among those who are the least
timid, and is equally manifest in the strong and the
weak, in those who can proffer and in those who might
crave protection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">3. The Desire of Esteem.</span></span> It is almost superfluous
to say that this is a native and indestructible element
of the human constitution. Its first manifestations
bear even date with the earliest displays of
intelligence and affection. To the infant, approval
is reward; rebuke, even by look, is punishment. The
hope of esteem is the most healthful and effective
stimulant in the difficult tasks of childhood and of
school-life. Under the discipline of parents both
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wise and good, it is among the most important and
salutary means of moral discipline. It is seldom deficient
in young persons. Their chief danger lies in
its excess; for when it is too strongly developed, it
inclines them to seek at all hazards the approval of
their associates for the time being. Hence the chief
danger from vicious or unscrupulous associates. The
first steps in vice are oftener prompted, no doubt, by
the desire for the complacent regard of one's companions
than by an antecedent disposition to evil.
Indeed, the confession is often made, that these steps
were taken with compunction and horror, solely from
the fear of ridicule and from the desire to win the
approval and favor of older transgressors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, the desire of the esteem of good
men is one of the strongest auxiliary motives to
virtue; while a yearning for the Divine approval
forms an essential part of true piety towards God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">4. The Desire of Power.</span></span> This is manifested in
every period of life, and in the exercise of every faculty,
bodily, mental, and moral. It is this which gives
us pleasure in solitary exercises of physical strength,
in climbing mountains, swimming, lifting heavy
weights, performing difficult gymnastic feats. It is
this, more than deliberate cruelty, that induces boys
to torture animals, or to oppress and torment their
weaker or more timid companions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In intellectual pursuits, the love of power leads to
many exercises and efforts that have no ulterior
result. The mathematician will turn aside from his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
course of study to master a problem, which involves
no new principle, but is merely difficult and perplexing.
The reading of books obscurely written, or in
languages that task the utmost power of analysis, frequently
has no other result, and probably no other
object, than the trial of strength. What can be attained
only by strenuous mental labor, is for that very
reason sought, even if it promise no utility.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the affairs of practical life, every man desires
to make his influence felt. With persons of the
highest character, the love of power is manifest in
connection with the aim to be useful. Even the most
modest men, while they may spurn flattery, are gladdened
by knowing that they are acting upon the wills
and shaping the characters of those around them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The love of property belongs in great part under
this head. Money is power, preëminently so at
the present day. Property confers influence, and
puts at one's command resources that may be the
means of extended and growing power alike over inanimate
nature and the wills of men. Avarice, or
the desire of money for its own sake, is not an original
desire. Few or none are avaricious in very early
life. But money, first sought for the power it confers,
from being a means becomes an end, to such a
degree that, in order to possess it, the miser will
forego the very uses for which he at the outset
learned to value it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">5. The Desire of Superiority.</span></span> This is so nearly
universal in all conditions of society, and at all periods
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of life, that it must be regarded as an original element
of human nature. Without it there would be
little progress. In every department of life, men
stimulate one another toward a higher standard of
endeavor, attainment, or excellence. What each does,
his neighbor would fain outdo; what each becomes,
his neighbor would fain surpass. It is only by perversion
that this desire tends to evil. It finds its
proper satisfaction, not in crushing, depressing, or injuring
a rival, but barely in overtaking and excelling
him; and the higher his point of attainment, the
greater is the complacency experienced in reaching
and transcending it. On the race-ground, I do not
want to compete with a slow runner, nor will it afford
me the slightest satisfaction to win the race by tripping
up my competitor; what I want is to match myself
with the best runner on a fair field, and to show
myself his equal or superior. The object striven for
is the individual's own ideal, and those whom he successively
passes on his course mark but successive
stages on his progress toward that ideal. Thus, in
the pursuit of moral excellence, it is only a mean and
a bad man who can imagine that he gains anything
by detracting from the merit of others; but he who
is sincerely contending for a high place among virtuous
men, rejoices in the signal examples of goodness
of every kind which it is his privilege to emulate, and
rejoices most of all that the ideal of perfect excellence—once
only actualized in human form—is so
pure and lofty that it may be his life-work to approach
it without reaching it.

Emulation is not envy, nor need it lead to envy.
Among those who strive for superiority there need be
no collision. The natural desire is to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be</span></em>, not to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em>,
superior; to have the consciousness, not the mere outward
semblance, of high attainment; and of attainment,
not by a conventional, but by an absolute standard;
and this aim excludes none,—there may be as
many first places as there are deserving candidates
for them. Then, too, there is so wide a diversity of
ideals, both in degree and in kind, there are so many
different ruling aims, and so many different routes by
which these aims are pursued, that there need be little
danger of mutual interference. Even as regards
external rewards, so far as they depend on the bounty
of nature, the constitution of society, or the general
esteem and good will of men, the success of one does
not preclude the equal success of many; but, on the
other hand, the merited prosperity and honor of the
individual cannot fail to be of benefit to the whole
community. It is only in offices contingent on election
or appointment that the aspirant incurs a heavy
risk of failure; but when we consider how meanly
men are often compelled to creep into office and to
grovel in it, it can hardly be supposed that a genuine
desire of superiority holds a prominent place among
the motives of these who are willingly dependent on
patronage or on popular suffrage.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Love</span></span> needs no definition, and admits of none. It
probably never exists uncaused; though it survives
all real or imagined ground for it, and in some cases
seems rendered only the more intense by the admitted
unworthiness of its object. When it is not the reason
for marriage, it can hardly fail to grow from the
conjugal relation between one man and one woman,
if the mutual duties belonging to that relation be
held sacred. It is inconceivable that a mother should
not love her child, inevitably cast upon her protection
from the first moment of his being; the father
who extends a father's care over his children finds in
that care a constant source of love; and the children,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
waking into conscious life under the ministries of
parental benignity and kindness, have no emotion so
early, and no early emotion so strong, as filial love.
It may be doubted whether there is among the members
of the same family a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></span> affection, independent
of relations practically recognized in domestic
life. It is very certain that at both extremities of the
social scale family affection is liable to be impaired,
on the one hand, by the delegation of parental duties
to hirelings, and, on the other, by the inability to
render them constantly and efficiently. We may
observe also a difference in family affection, traceable
indirectly to the influence of climate. Out-of-door
life is unfavorable to the intimate union of families;
while domestic love is manifestly the strongest in
those countries where the shelter and hearth of the
common home are necessary for a large portion of the
year.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Love for the Supreme Being</span></span>, or piety, differs not
in kind from the child's love for the parent; but it
rightfully transcends all other love, inasmuch as the
benefits received from God include and surpass all
other benefits. To awake, then, to a consciousness of
our actual relation to God, is <span class="tei tei-q">“to love Him with all
the heart, and with all the understanding, and all the

superiority in such traits of mind and character as we
regard with complacency in ourselves, or with esteem
in our equals. Qualities which we do not esteem we
may behold with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">admiration</span></span> (that is, wonder), but
not with reverence. Our reverence for age is not for
advanced years alone, but for the valuable experience
which they are supposed to have given, and especially
for the maturity of excellence which belongs to the
old age of good men, of which their features generally
bear the impress, and which, in the absence of
knowledge, we are prone to ascribe to a venerable
mien and aspect. A foolish or wicked old man commands
no reverence by his years.

Gratitude, though it can hardly be disjoined from
love, is seldom cherished for the same person in the
same degree with love. We love our beneficiaries
more than our benefactors. We love those dependent
upon us more than those on whom we depend. The
mother's love for her child is the strongest of human
affections, and undoubtedly exceeds that even of the
child for the mother to whom he owes every benefit
and blessing under heaven. We may be fervently
grateful to persons whom we have never seen; but
there cannot be much vividness in our love for them.
Love to God, whom we have not seen, needs to be
kindled, renewed, and sustained by gratitude for the
incessant flow of benefits from Him, and by the

may be needed. In its lower forms it is designated
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">good nature</span></span>; when intense and universal, it is
termed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philanthropy</span></span>. It befits the individual man as
a member of a race of kindred, and is deemed so essential
an attribute of the human character, that he
who utterly lacks it is branded as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inhuman</span></span>, while its
active exercise in the relief of want and suffering is
emphatically termed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humanity</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pity is the emotion occasioned by the sight or
knowledge of distress or pain. While without it
there can be no genuine kindness, it may exist without
kindness. There are persons tenderly sensitive to
every form of suffering, who yet feel only for the sufferer,
not with him, and who would regard and treat
him coldly or harshly, if he were not a sufferer. In
such cases, pity would seem to be a selfish feeling;
and there can be no doubt that some men relieve distress
and poverty, as they would remove weeds from
a flower-bed, because they are offensive to the sight.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Sympathy</span></span> is feeling, not for, but with

though its necessity is less felt and its offices are less
prized in happy than in sad experiences. Kindness
alone cannot produce sympathy. In order to feel
with another, we must either have passed through
similar experiences, or must have an imagination sufficiently
vivid to make them distinctly present to our
thought. This latter power is by no means necessary
to create even the highest degree of kindness or of
pity; and among the most active and persevering in
works of practical beneficence, there are many who
feel intensely for, yet but faintly with, the objects of
their charity. On the other hand, sympathy sometimes
finds its chief exercise in sensational literature,
and there are persons, profoundly moved by fictitious
representations of distress, who yet remain inactive
and indifferent as regards the real needs and sufferings
around them that crave relief.

2. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">malevolent affections</span></span> are Anger, Resentment,
Envy, Revenge, and Hatred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Anger</span></span> is the sense of indignation occasioned by
real or imagined wrong. When excited by actual
wrong-doing, and when contained within reasonable
bounds, it is not only innocent, but salutary. It intensifies
the virtuous feeling which gives it birth; and
its due expression is among the safeguards of society
against corruption and evil. But when indulged
without sufficient cause, or suffered to become excessive
or to outlast its occasion, it is in itself evil, and it
may lead to any and every form of social injustice,
and of outrage against the rights of man and the law
of God.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Resentment</span></span> is the feeling excited by injury done
to ourselves. This also is innocent and natural, when
its occasion is sufficient, and its limits reasonable. It
may prevent the repetition of injury, and the spontaneous
tendency to it, which is almost universal, is
an efficient defence against insult, indignity, and encroachment
on the rights of individuals. But, indulged
or prolonged beyond the necessity of self-defence,
it is prone to reverse the parties, and to make
the injured person himself the wrong-doer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Both anger and resentment are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">painful emotions</span></span>,
and on this account are self-limited in a well-ordered
mind. He who makes happiness his aim will, if wise,
give these disturbing forces the least possible hold
upon him, whether in intensity or in duration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Envy</span></span> has been defined as the excess of emulation.
It seems rather to be a deficiency in the genuine principle
of emulation. The instinctive desire of superiority
leads us, as we have seen, to aim at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></span>
high attainments, and to measure ourselves less by
what others are, than by our own ideal. It is only
those of lower aims, who seek to supplant others on
their career. Envy is the attempt, not to rise or excel,
but to stand comparatively high by subverting
those who hold or seek a higher position. No just
man voted for the banishment of Aristides because he
was always called the Just; but his ostracism was the
decree of those who knew that they could obtain no
reputation for justice till he were put out of their
way.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Revenge</span></span> is the desire to inflict evil for evil. In
principle it is always wrong; for the evil-doer,
though he may merit transient anger and resentment,
is not therefore placed beyond our benevolence, but is
rather commended to our charity as one who may be
reformed and may become worthy of our esteem. In
practice, revenge can scarce ever be just. Our self-love
so exaggerates our estimate of the wrong we receive,
that we could hardly fail to retaliate by greater
wrong, and thus to provoke a renewal of the injury.
There are, no doubt, cases in which self-defence may
authorize the immediate chastisement or disabling of
the wrong-doer, and in an unsettled state of society,
where there is no legal protection, it may be the right
of individuals to punish depredation or personal outrage;
but acts of this kind are to be justified on the
plea of necessity, not of revenge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Hatred</span></span> is the result of either of the malevolent
affections above named, when carried to excess, or
suffered to become permanent. It precludes the exercise
of all the benevolent affections. No man can
rightfully be the object of hatred; for there is no
man who has not within him some element or possibility
of good, none who has not rights that should
be respected, none who is not entitled to pity for his
sufferings, and, still more, for his sins.

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

The affections, benevolent and malevolent, are
common to man with lower animals. Love and

open to our inspection; anger, by not a few; gratitude,

by the more intelligent; envy, by those most
completely domesticated; reverence, perhaps, by the
dog towards his master.

The affections all prompt to action, and do not
discriminate the qualities of actions. Hence they
need the control and guidance of reason, and can

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The appetites, desires, and affections constitute the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">impelling force</span></span> in all action. Were we not possessed
of them, we should not act. There is no act
of any kind, good or bad, noble or base, mental or
bodily, of which one or another of them is not the
proximate cause. They are also imperative in their
demands. They crave immediate action,—the appetites,
in procuring or using the means of bodily gratification;
the desires, in the increase of their objects;
the affections, in seeking or bestowing their appropriate
tokens or expressions, whether good or evil.
Were there no check, the specific appetite, desire, or
affection to which circumstances gave the ascendency
for the time being, would act in its appropriate direction,
until counteracted by another, brought into supremacy
by a new series of circumstances. This is
the case with brutes, so far as we can observe their
modes of action. Here, in man, reason intervenes,
and takes cognizance of the tendencies and the qualities
of actions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Reason</span></span> considers actions under two points of view,—interest
and obligation,—expediency and right.
The questions which we inwardly ask concerning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actions all resolve themselves into one of these,—Is
the act useful or desirable for me? or, Is it my right
or my duty? He who is wont to ask the former of
these questions is called a prudent man; he who
habitually asks the latter is termed a virtuous or good
man. He who asks neither of them yields himself,
after the manner of the brutes, to the promptings of
appetite, desire, and affection, and thus far omits to
exercise the reason which distinguishes him from the
brutes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There can be no doubt that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">expediency and right
coincide</span></span>. Under the government of Supreme Benevolence,
it is impossible that what ought to be done
should not conduce to the welfare of him who does
it. But its beneficent results may be too remote for
him to trace them, nay, may belong to a life beyond
death, to which human cognizance does not reach;
while what ought not to be done may promise substantial
benefit so far as man's foresight extends.
Then, too, it is at least supposable that there may be
cases, in which, were they solitary cases, expediency
might diverge from right, yet in which, because they
belong to a class, it is for the interest of society and
of every individual member of society that general
laws should be obeyed. It is obvious also, that there
are many cases, in which the calculation of expediency
involves details too numerous and too complicated
to be fully understood by a mind of ordinary
discernment, while the same mind can clearly perceive
what course of conduct is in accordance with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strict rule of right. Still farther, in a question of
conduct in which appetite, desire, or affection is concerned,
we cannot take as calm and dispassionate a
view of our true interest, as we should of the interest
of another person in like case. The impelling force
may be so strong, that for the time being we sincerely
regard it as expedient—though we know that it is
not right—to yield to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For these reasons there is an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">apparent conflict between
the useful and the right</span></span>. Though a perfectly
wise and dispassionate man might give precisely the
same answer in every instance to the question of interest
and that of duty, men, limited and influenced
as they are, can hardly fail in many instances to answer
these questions differently. The man who makes
his own imagined good his ruling aim does many
things which he would not defend on the ground of
right; the man who determines always to do right
sometimes performs acts of reputed and conscious self-denial
and self-sacrifice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor yet can more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">general</span></span>
considerations of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">expediency</span></span>,
reference to the good of others, to the greatest
good of the greatest number, serve as a guide to the
right or a test of the right. We have less foresight
as regards others than as regards ourselves; the details
involved in the true interest of any community,
society, or number of persons, are necessarily more
numerous and complicated than those involved in our
own well-being; and, if not appetite or desire, the
benevolent or malevolent affections are fully as apt to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
warp our judgment and to misdirect our conduct in
the case of others as in our own case.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We perceive then that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">expediency</span></span>, whether with
reference to ourselves or to others, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">is not a trustworthy
rule of conduct</span></span>. Yet while it cannot hold
the first place, it occupies an important place; for
there are many cases in which the question before us
is not what we ought to do, but what it is best for us
to do. Thus, if there be several acts, all equally right,
only one of which can be performed, we are evidently
entitled to perform the act which will be most pleasing
or useful to ourselves. If there be an end which
it is our right or duty to attain, and there be several
equally innocent modes of attaining it, the question
for us is, by which of these modes we may find the
least difficulty or gain the highest enjoyment or advantage.
If there be several duties incumbent upon
us at the same time and place, all of which have
equal intrinsic claims, yet one of which must necessarily
take precedence of the rest, the question which
shall have precedence is a question of expediency,
that by which we may do the most good being the
foremost duty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Expediency is not a characteristic of actions.</span></span>
An act is not in itself expedient or inexpedient,
but is made one or the other by varying circumstances
alone; while there are acts in themselves
good which no possible circumstances could make bad,
and there are acts in themselves bad which no possible
circumstances could make good. If, therefore,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there be a science which has for its province the intrinsic
qualities of actions, questions of expediency have
no place in such a science.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Moral Philosophy, or Ethics</span></span> (synonymous terms),
is the science which treats of human actions. The
term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">morals</span></span> is often applied to external actions; but
always with reference to the intentions from which
they proceed. We can conceive of the treatment of
actions under various aspects, as wise or unwise,
agreeable or disagreeable, spontaneous or deliberate;
but by the common consent of mankind, at least of
the civilized and enlightened portion of mankind, the
distinction of actions as right or wrong is regarded as
of an importance so far transcending all other distinctions,
as to render them of comparatively little moment.
Therefore Moral Philosophy confines itself to
this single distinction, and takes cognizance of others,
only as they modify this, or are modified by it. The
questions which Moral Philosophy asks and answers
are these:—What constitutes the right? How is it
to be ascertained? Wherein lies the obligation to
the right? What are the motives to right action?
What specific actions, or classes of actions are right,
and why? What specific actions, or classes of actions
are wrong, and why?

or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unfitness</span></span> as regards other
objects. Every object is at every moment under the
control of the intelligent will of the Supreme Being,
or of some finite being, and is by that will maintained
either in or out of its place, purpose, uses, or relations,
and thus in a state of fitness or unfitness with regard
to other objects. Every intelligent being, by virtue
of his existence, bears certain definite relations to outward
objects, to his fellow-beings, and to his Creator.
At every moment, each intelligent being is either
faithful or unfaithful to these relations, and thus in a
state of fitness or unfitness as regards outward objects
and other beings. Thus fitness or unfitness may be
affirmed, at every moment, of every object in existence,
of the volition by which each object is controlled,
and of every intelligent being, with regard to
the exercise of his will toward or upon outward
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
objects or his fellow-beings. Fitness and unfitness are
the ultimate ideas that are involved in the terms
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></span>. These last are metaphorical terms,—right
(Latin, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">rectus</span></span>),
straight, upright, according
to rule, and therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fit</span></span>;
wrong, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">wrung</span></span>, distorted,
deflected, twisted out of place, contrary to rule, and
therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unfit</span></span>. We are so constituted that we cannot
help regarding fitness with complacency and
esteem; unfitness, with disesteem and disapproval,
even though we ourselves create it or impersonate it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Fitness</span></span> is the only standard by which we regard
our own actions or the actions of others as good or
evil,—by which we justify or condemn ourselves or
others. Duty has fitness for its only aim and end. To
whatever object comes under our control, its fit place,
purpose, uses, and relations are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">due</span></span>; and our perception
of what is thus due constitutes our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">duty</span></span>, and
awakens in us a sense of obligation. To ourselves,
and to other beings and objects, our fidelity to our
relations has in it an intrinsic fitness; that fitness is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">due</span></span> to them and to ourselves; and our perception of
what is thus due constitutes our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">duty</span></span>, and awakens in
us a sense of obligation.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Right and wrong are not contingent on the
knowledge of the moral agent.</span></span> Unfitness, misuse,
abuse, is none the less intrinsically wrong, because it
is the result of ignorance. It is out of harmony with
the fitness of things. It deprives an object of its
due use. It perverts to pernicious results what is
salutary in its purpose. It lessens for the agent his

aggregate of good and of happiness, and increases
for him his aggregate of evil and of misery. In this
sense—far more significant than that of arbitrary
infliction—the well-known maxim of jurisprudence,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ignorance of the law excuses no one,”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> is a fundamental
law of nature.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, however, an important distinction between
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">absolute and relative right</span></span>. In action, the absolute
right is conduct in entire conformity with beings and
objects as they are; the relative right is conduct in
accordance with beings and objects as, with the best
means of knowledge within our reach, we believe
them to be. The Omniscient Being alone can have
perfect knowledge of all beings and things as they are.
This knowledge is possessed by men in different
degrees, corresponding to their respective measures of
intelligence, sagacity, culture, and personal or traditional
experience. In the ruder conditions of society,
acts that seem to us atrociously wrong, often proceed
from honest and inevitable misapprehension, are right
in their intention, and are therefore proper objects of
moral approbation. In an advanced condition of intelligence,
and especially under high religious culture,
though the realm of things unknown far exceeds that
of things known, there is a sufficiently clear understanding
of the objects and relations of ordinary life
to secure men against sins of ignorance, and to leave
in their wrong-doing no semblance or vestige of right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The distinction between absolute and relative right
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enables us to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">reconcile two statements that may
have seemed inconsistent</span></span> with each other, namely,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the character of an action, whether good or bad,
depends on the intention of the agent,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“that unfitness,
misuse, abuse, is none the less wrong because
the result of ignorance.”</span> Both these propositions are
true. The same act may be in intent right and good,
and yet, through defect of knowledge, wrong and
evil; and it may, in virtue of its good intent, be
attended and followed by beneficent results, while at
the same time the evil that there is in it may be
attended or followed by injurious consequences. We
may best illustrate this double character of actions by
a case so simple that we can see through it at a single
glance. I will suppose that I carry to a sick person a
potion which I believe to be an efficient remedy, but
which, by a mistake for which I am not accountable,
proves to be a deadly poison. My act, by the standard
of absolute right, is an unfitting and therefore a
wrong act, and it has its inevitable result in killing
the patient. But because my intention was right, I
have not placed myself in any wrong relation to God
or man. Nay, if I procured what I supposed to be a
healing potion with care, cost, and trouble, and for
one whose suffering and need were his only claim
upon me, I have by my labor of love brought myself
into an even more intimate relation, filial and fraternal,
with God and man, the result of which must be
my enhanced usefulness and happiness. If on the
other hand I had meant to poison the man, but had by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mistake given him a healing potion, my act would
have been absolutely right, because conformed to the
fitness of things, but relatively wrong, because in its
intention and purpose opposed to the fitness of things;
and as in itself fitting, it would have done the sick
man good, while, as in its purpose unfitting, it would
have thrown me out of the relations in which I
ought to stand both with God and man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Mistakes as to specific acts of duty</span></span> bear the
closest possible analogy to the case of the poison
given for medicine. The savage, who sincerely means
to express reverence, kindness, loyalty, fidelity, may
perform, in the expression of those sentiments, acts
that are utterly unfitting, and therefore utterly
wrong; and if so, each of these acts produces its due
consequences, it may be, baleful and lamentable. Yet
because he did the best he knew in the expression of
these sentiments, he has not sunk, but risen in his
character as a moral being,—has become better and
more capable of good.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Ignorance of the right</span></span>, however, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">is innocent, only
when inevitable</span></span>. At the moment of action, indeed,
what seems to me fitting is relatively right, and were
I to do otherwise, even though my act were absolutely
right, it would be relatively wrong. But if I have
had and neglected the means of knowing the right, I
have violated the fitnesses of my own nature by not
employing my cognitive powers on subjects of vital
importance to my well-being. In this case, though

is the power of perceiving fitness and unfitness. Yet
more, it is consciousness,—a sense of our own personal
relation to the fitting and the unfitting, of our
power of actualizing them in intention, will, and conduct.
It is in this last particular that man differs
from the lower animals. They have an instinctive
perception of fitness, and an instinctive impulse to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">illustrate the function of conscience</span></span> by
reference to a question now agitated in our community,—the
question as to the moral fitness of the
moderate use of fermented liquors. In civilized
society, intoxication is universally known to be opposed
to the fitnesses of body and mind, an abuse of
alcoholic liquors, and an abuse of the drinker's own
personality; and it is therefore condemned by all consciences,
by none more heartily than by those of its
victims. But there still remains open the question
whether entire abstinence from fermented liquors be
a duty, and this is a question of fact. Says one
party, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alcohol, in every form, and in the least quantity,
is a virulent poison, and therefore unfit for body
and mind.”</span> Says the other party, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wine, moderately
used, is healthful, salutary, restorative, and
therefore fitted to body and mind.”</span> Change the
opinion of the latter party, their consciences would
at once take the other side; and if they retained in
precept and practice their present position, they would
retain it self-condemned. Change the opinion of the
former party, their consciences would assume the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ground which they now assail. Demonstrate to the
whole community—as it is to be hoped physiology
will do at no distant day—the precise truth in this
matter, there would remain no difference of conscientious
judgment, whatever difference of practice might
still continue.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Conscience</span></span>, like all the perceptive faculties,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">prompts to action in accordance with its perceptions</span></span>.
In this respect it differs not in the least from
sight, hearing, taste. Our natural proclivity is to
direct our movements with reference to the objects
within the field of our vision, to govern our conduct
by what we hear, to take into our mouths only substances
that are pleasing to the taste. Yet fright,
temerity, or courage may impel us to incur dangers
which we clearly see; opiniativeness or obstinacy
may make us inwardly deaf to counsels or warnings
which we hear; and motives of health may induce us
to swallow the most nauseous drugs. In like manner,
our inevitable tendency is to govern our conduct by the
fitness of things when clearly perceived; but intense
and unrestrained appetite, desire, or affection may
lead us to violate that fitness, though distinctly seen
and acknowledged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Men act in opposition to conscience only under
immediate and strong temptation.</span></span> The great majority
of the acts of bad men are conscientious, but
not therefore meritorious; for merit consists not in
doing right when there is no temptation to evil, but
in resisting temptation. But, as has been said, it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as natural, when there is no inducement to the contrary,
to act in accordance with the fitness of things,
as it is to act in accordance with what we see and
hear. It is the tendency so to act, that alone renders
human society possible, in the absence of high moral
principle. In order to live, a man must so act with
reference to outward nature; still more must he so
act, in order to possess human fellowship, physical
comfort, transient enjoyment, of however low a type;
and the most depraved wretch that walks the earth
purchases his continued being and whatever pleasure
he derives from it by a thousand acts in accordance
with the fitness of things to one in which he violates
that fitness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Conscience</span></span>, like all the
perceptive faculties, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">is educated
by use</span></span>. The watchmaker's or the botanist's
eye acquires an almost microscopic keenness of vision.
The blind man's hearing is so trained as to supply, in
great part, the lack of sight. The epicure's taste can
discriminate flavors whose differences are imperceptible
to an ordinary palate. In like manner, the conscience
that is constantly and carefully exercised in
judging of the fit and the unfitting, the right and the
wrong, becomes prompt, keen, searching, sensitive,
comprehensive, microscopic. On the other hand, conscience,
like the senses, if seldom called into exercise,
becomes sluggish, inert, incapable of minute discrimination,
or of vigilance over the ordinary conduct of
life. Yet it is never extinct, and is never perverted.
When roused to action, even in the most obdurate, it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
resumes its judicial severity, and records its verdict
in remorseful agony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Conscience is commonly said to be educated by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the
increase of knowledge</span></span> as to the relations of beings
and objects, as to the moral laws of the universe, and
as to religious verities. This, however, is not true.
Knowledge does not necessarily quicken the activity
of conscience, or enhance its discriminating power.
Conscience often is intense and vivid in the most
ignorant, inactive and torpid in persons whose cognitive
powers have had the most generous culture.
Knowledge, indeed, brings the decisions of conscience
into closer and more constant conformity with the absolute
right, but it does not render its decisions more
certainly in accordance with the relative right, that
is, with what the individual, from his point of view,
ought to will and do. It has the same effect upon
conscience that accurate testimony has upon the clear-minded
and uncorrupt judge, whose mind is not
made thereby the more active or discriminating, nor
his decision brought into closer accordance with the
facts as they are presented to him. Knowledge is
indeed an indispensable auxiliary to conscience; but
this cannot be affirmed exclusively of any specific
department of knowledge. It is true of all knowledge;
for there is no fact or law in the universe that
may not in some contingency become the subject-matter
or the occasion for the action of conscience.
Nothing could seem more remote from the ordinary
field of conscience than the theory of planetary motion;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet it was this that gave Galileo the one grand
opportunity of his life for testing the supremacy of
conscience,—it may be, the sole occasion on which his
conscience uttered itself strongly against his seeming
interest, and one on which obedience to conscience
would have averted the only cloud that ever rested on
his fame.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Except so far as there may have been direct communications
from the Supreme Being, all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">man's knowledge</span></span>
of persons, objects, and relations <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">is derived</span></span>, in
the last resort, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">from observation</span></span>. Experience is
merely remembered self-observation. Tradition, oral
and written, is accumulated and condensed observation;
and by means of this each new generation can
avail itself of the experience of preceding generations,
can thus find time to explore fresh departments
of knowledge, and so transmit its own traditions to
the generations that shall follow. Now what we observe
in objects is chiefly their properties, or, what is
the same thing, their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fitnesses</span></span>; for a property is that
which fits an object for a specific place or use. What
we observe in persons is their relations to other beings
and objects, with the fitnesses that belong to those
relations. What we experience all resolves itself into
the fitness or unfitness of persons and objects to one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">another</span></span> or to ourselves. What is transmitted in history
and in science is the record of fitnesses or unfitnesses
that have been ascertained by observation, or
tested by experience. The progress of knowledge is
simply an enlarged acquaintance with the fitnesses of
persons and things. He knows the most, who most
fully comprehends the relations in which the beings
and objects in the universe stand, have stood, and
ought to stand toward one another. Moreover, as
when we see a fitness within our sphere of action, we
perceive intuitively that it is right to respect it, wrong
to violate it, our knowledge of right and wrong is co-extensive
with our knowledge of persons and things.
The more enlightened and cultivated a nation is, then,
the more does it know as to right and wrong, whatever
may be its standard of practical morality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For instance, in the most savage condition, men
know, with reference to certain articles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">food and
drink</span></span>, that they are adapted to relieve the cravings of
hunger and thirst, and they know nothing more about
them. They are not acquainted with the laws of
health, whether of body or of mind. They therefore
eat and drink whatever comes to hand, without
imagining the possibility of wrong-doing in this matter.
But, with the progress of civilization, they
learn that various kinds of food and drink impair the
health, cloud the brain, enfeeble the working power,
and therefore are unfit for human use; and no sooner
is this known, than the distinction of right and wrong
begins to be recognized, as to what men eat and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
drink. The more thorough is the knowledge of the
human body and of the action of various substances
on its organs and tissues, the more minute and discriminating
will be the perception of fitness or unfitness
as to the objects that tempt the appetites, and
the keener will be the sense of right or wrong in
their use.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For another illustration of the same principle, we
may take <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the relation between parents and children</span></span>.
In the ruder stages of society, and especially
among a nomadic or migratory people, there is not a
sufficient knowledge of the resources of nature or the
possibilities of art, to render even healthy and vigorous
life more than tolerable; while for the infirm and
feeble, life is but a protracted burden and weariness.
At the same time, there is no apprehension of the intellectual
and moral worth of human life, still less, of
the value even of its most painful experiences as a
discipline of everlasting benefit. In fine, life is little
more than a mere struggle for existence. What wonder
then, that in some tribes filial piety has been
wont to relieve superannuated parents from an existence
devoid equally of joy and of hope; and that in
others parental love may have even dictated the exposure—with
a view to their perishing—of feeble,
sickly, and deformed children, incapable of being
nurtured into self-sustaining and self-depending life?
But increased conversance with nature and art constantly
reveals new capacities of comfort and happiness
in life, and that, not for the strong alone, but for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the feeble, the suffering, the helpless, so that there are
none to whom humanity knows not how to render
continued life desirable. At the same time, a higher
culture has made it manifest that the frailest body
may be the seat of the loftiest mental activity, moral
excellence, and spiritual aspiration, and that in such a
body there is often only a surer and more finished
education for a higher state of being. Filial piety
and parental love, therefore, do all in their power to
prolong the flickering existence of the age-worn and
decrepit, and to cherish with tender care the life
which seems born but to die. There is, then, to the
limited view of the savage, an apparent fitness in
practices which in their first aspect seem crimes
against nature; while increased knowledge develops
a real and essential fitness, in all the refinements and
endearments of the most persevering and skilful love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These examples, which might be multiplied indefinitely,
show <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the dependence of conscience on
knowledge</span></span>, not for relatively right decisions, but for
verdicts in accordance with the absolute right. There
is no subject that can be presented for the action of
conscience, on which, upon precisely the same principles,
divergent and often opposite courses of conduct
may not be dictated by more or less accurate knowledge
of the subject and its relations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be seen, also, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">with the growth of
knowledge, conscience has a constantly wider
scope of action</span></span>. The number of indifferent acts is
thus diminished; the number of positively right or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wrong acts, increased. An <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferent</span></span> act is one for
the performance of which, rather than its opposite,
no reason, involving a question of right or wrong, can
be given. Thus, if the performance or the omission
of a specific act be equally fitted to the time, place,
circumstances, and persons concerned, the act is an
indifferent one; or, if two or more ways of accomplishing
a desired end be equally fitted to time, place,
circumstances, and persons, the choice between these
ways is, morally speaking, a matter of indifference.
But with a knowledge both more extensive and more
minute of the nature, relations, and fitnesses of beings
and objects, we find an increasing number of instances
in which acts that seemed indifferent have a
clearly perceptible fitness or unfitness, and thus acquire
a distinct moral character as right or wrong.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Law is the result of the collective experience</span></span>,
in part, of particular communities, in part, of the
human race as a whole. It encourages, protects, or at
least permits whatever acts or modes of conduct have
been found or believed to be fitting, in accordance
with the nature of things and the well-being of men,
and therefore right; it forbids and punishes such acts
or modes of conduct as have been found or believed to
be unfitting, opposed to nature and to human well-being,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and therefore wrong. It is far from perfect;
it is below the standard of the most advanced minds;
but it represents the average knowledge or belief
of the community to which it belongs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The laws</span></span>
of any particular state cannot rise far above this
average; for laws unsustained by general opinion
could not be executed, and if existing in the statute-book,
they would not have the nature and force of
law, and would remain on record simply because they
had lapsed out of notice. Nor can they fall far
below this average; for no government can sustain
itself while its legislation fails to meet the demands
of the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">law</span></span> thus expresses the average knowledge
of belief, it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">tends to perpetuate its own moral standard</span></span>.
The notions of right which it embodies form a
part of the general education. The specific crimes,
vices, and wrongs which the law marks out for punishment
are regarded by young persons, from their
earliest years, as worthy of the most emphatic censure
and condemnation; while those which the law leaves
unpunished are looked upon as comparatively slight
and venial. Not only so, the degree of detestation in
which a community learns to look on specific crimes
and offences is not in proportion to their actual heinousness,
but to the stress of overt ignominy attached
to them by legal penalties. Instances of this effect
of law on opinion will be readily called to mind.
Thus a common thief loses, and can hardly regain his
position in society; while the man who by dishonest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bankruptcy commits a hundred thefts in one, can
hold his place unchallenged, even in the Christian
church, while it is known to every one that he is living—it
may be in luxury—on the money he has
stolen. The obvious reason is that from time immemorial
simple theft has been punished with due, when
not with undue, severity, while the comparatively
recent crime of fraudulent bankruptcy has as yet
been brought very imperfectly within the grasp of
penal law. Again, no man of clear moral discernment
can doubt that he who consciously and willingly
imbrutes himself by intoxication is more blameworthy
than he who sells alcoholic liquors without knowing
whether they are to be used internally or externally,
moderately or immoderately, for medicine or for luxury.
Yet because the latter makes himself liable to
fine and imprisonment, while the former—unless he
belong to the unprivileged classes—has legal protection,
instead of the disgraceful punishment he deserves,
there is a popular prejudice against the vender
of strong drink, and a strange tenderness toward the
intemperate consumer. Yet another instance. There
are crimes worse than murder. There are modes of
moral corruption and ruin, whose victims it were
mercy to kill. But while the murderer, if he escape
the gallows, is an outcast and an object of universal
abhorrence, no social ban rests upon him whose crime
has been the death of innocence and purity, yet, if
reached at all by law, can be compounded by the payment
of money.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though law is in many respects an imperfect
moral teacher, and its deficiencies are to be regretted,
its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">educational power</span></span> is strongly felt for good,
especially in communities where the administration of
justice is strict and impartial. It is of no little worth
that a child grows up with some fixed beliefs as to
the turpitude of certain forms of evil, especially as
the positive enactments of the penal law almost
always coincide with the wisest judgments of the
best men in the community. Moreover, law is progressive
in every civilized community, and in proportion
as it approaches the standard of absolute
right, it tends to bring the moral beliefs of the people
into closer conformity with the same standard. It is,
then, a partial and narrow view of law to regard it
only or chiefly as the instrument of society for the
detection and punishment, or even for the direct prevention
of crime. Its far more important function is
so to train the greater part of each rising generation,
that certain forms and modes of evil-doing shall never
enter into their plans or purposes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">civil</span></span>, no less than the criminal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">law is a source
of knowledge as to the right</span></span>. The law does not create,
but merely defines the rights appertaining to
persons and property. The laws of different nations
are, indeed, widely different; but there may be that
in their respective histories which makes a difference
in the actual rights of citizens, or their civil codes may
present different stages of approach toward the right.
Thus the laws as to the conveyance and inheritance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of property are in some respects unlike in France,
England, and the United States, and vary considerably
in the several States of our Union; but there generally
exist historical reasons for this variation, and it
would be found that the ends of justice are best
served, and the reasonable expectations of the people
best met in each community, by its own methods of
procedure. By the law of the land, then, we may
learn civil rights and obligations, which we have not
the means of ascertaining by our own independent
research.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remains for us to speak of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">factitious rights
and wrongs</span></span>, supposed to be created by law. Of
these there are many. Thus one mode of transacting
a sale or transfer is in itself as good as another; and
it might be plausibly maintained that, if the business
be fairly and honorably conducted, it matters not
whether the legally prescribed forms—sometimes
burdensome and costly—be complied with or omitted.
The law, it may be said, here creates an obligation
for which there is no ground in nature or the
fitness of things. This we deny. It is intrinsically
fitting that all transactions which are liable to dispute
or question should be performed in ways in which
they can be attested; and this cannot be effected
except by the establishment of uniform methods. He
who departs from them performs not only an illegal,
but an immoral act; and the legal provisions of the
kind under discussion have an educational value in
enlarging the knowledge of the individual as to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conditions and means of security, order, and good
understanding in human society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Similar considerations apply to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">crimes created
by law</span></span>. Smuggling may serve as an instance. Undoubtedly
there are smugglers who would not steal;
and their apology is that they are but exercising the
rights of ownership upon their own property. But
the public must have property, else its community is
dissolved; government must be able to avail itself of
that property, else its functions are suspended. Men
need to be taught that the rights of the state are
inseparable from those of individuals, and no less
sacred, and the laws that protect the revenue are
among the most efficient means of teaching this
lesson. Their only defect is that they attach less
ignominy to frauds upon the revenue than to other
modes of theft, and thus fail to declare the whole
truth, that there is no moral difference between him
who robs the public and him who robs any one of its
individual members.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Religion</span></span>, in its relation to ethics, may be regarded
both as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">a source of knowledge</span></span>, and as supplying
motives for the performance of duty. We are now
concerned with it in the former aspect; and it will
be sufficient for our present purpose to ascertain how
much <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Christianity</span></span> adds to our knowledge of the fitnesses
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that underlie all questions of right and duty.
We by no means undervalue the beneficent ministry
of natural religion in the department of ethics; but
the most sceptical admit that Christianity includes
all of natural religion, while its disciples claim that
it not only teaches natural religion with a certainty,
precision, and authority which else were wanting, but
imparts a larger and profounder knowledge of God
and the universe than is within the scope of man's
unaided reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Christianity covers the entire field of human
duty</span></span>, and reveals many fitnesses, recognized when
seen, but discovered by few or none independently of
the teachings and example of its Founder; while it
gives the emphasis and sanction of a Divine revelation
to many other fitnesses, easily discoverable, but
liable to be overlooked and neglected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In defining <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the relations of the individual human
soul to God</span></span>, Christianity opens to our view a department
of duty paramount to all others in importance
and interest. His fatherly love and care, his moral
government and discipline, his retributive providence,
define with unmistakable distinctness certain corresponding
modes, in part, of outward action, and in
still greater part, of action in that inward realm of
thought whence the outward life receives its direction
and impulse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The brotherhood of the whole human race</span></span>, also,
reveals obligations which would exist on no other
ground; and for the clear and self-evidencing statement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this truth we are indebted solely to Christianity.
The visible differences of race, color, culture,
religion, and customs, are in themselves dissociating
influences. Universal charity is impossible while
these differences occupy the foreground. Slavery was
a natural and congenial institution under Pagan auspices;
nor have we in all ancient extra-Christian
literature, unless it be in Seneca (in whom such sentiments
may have had indirectly<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> a Christian origin),
a single expression of a fellowship broad enough to
embrace all diversities of condition, much less, of race.
But the Christian, so far as he consents to receive the
obvious and undoubted import of Christ's mission and
teachings, must regard all men as, in nature, in the
paternal care of the Divine Providence, in religious
privileges, rights, and capacities, on an equal footing.
With this view, he cannot but perceive the fitness,
and therefore the obligation, of many forms of social
duty, of enlarged beneficence, of unlimited philanthropy,
which on any restricted theory of human
brotherhood would be neither fitting nor reasonable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The immortality of the soul</span></span>, in the next place,
casts a light at once broad and penetrating upon and
into every department of duty; for it is obvious,
without detailed statement, that the fitnesses, needs,
and obligations of a terrestrial being of brief duration,
and those of a being in the nursery and first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stage of an endless existence, are very wide apart,—that
the latter may find it fitting, and therefore may
deem it right, to do, seek, shun, omit, endure, resign,
many things which to the former are very properly
matters of indifference. Immortality was, in a certain
sense, believed before the advent of Christ, but
not with sufficient definiteness and assurance to occupy
a prominent place in any ethical system, or to
furnish the point of view from which all things in the
earthly life were to be regarded. Indeed, some of
the most virtuous of the ancients, among others
Epictetus, than whom there was no better man, expressly
denied the life after death, and, of course,
could have had no conception of the aspects of human
and earthly affairs as seen in the light of eternity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity makes yet another contribution to ethical
knowledge in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the person and character of its
Founder</span></span>, exhibiting in him the very fitnesses it prescribes,
showing us, as it could not in mere precept,
the proportions and harmonies of the virtues, and
manifesting the unapproached beauty and majesty of
the gentler virtues,<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> which in pre-Christian ages were
sometimes made secondary, sometimes repudiated with
contempt and derision. We cannot overestimate the
importance of this teaching by example. The instances
are very numerous, in which the fitness of a specific
mode of conduct can be tested only by experiment;
and Jesus Christ tried successfully several experiments
in morals that had not been tried before within the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
memory of man, and evinced, in his own person and
by the success of his religion, the superior worth and
efficacy of qualities which had not previously borne
the name of virtues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity still further enlarges our ethical knowledge
by declaring the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">universality of moral laws</span></span>.
There are many cases, in which it might seem to us
not only expedient, but even right, to set aside some
principle acknowledged to be valid in the greater
number of instances, to violate justice or truth for
some urgent claim of charity, or to consent to the
performance of a little evil for the accomplishment of
a great good. But in all such cases Christianity interposes
its peremptory precepts, assuring us on authority
which the Christian regards as supreme and infallible,
that there are no exceptions or qualifications to any
rule of right; that the moral law, in all its parts, is of
inalienable obligation, and that the greatest good cannot
but be the ultimate result of inflexible obedience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Christianity gives a fuller knowledge of the
right</span></span> than can be attained independently of its teachings,
is shown by the review of all extra-Christian
ethical systems. There is not one of these which does
not confessedly omit essential portions of the right,
and hardly one which does not sanction dispositions
and modes of conduct confessedly wrong and evil;
while even those who disclaim Christianity as a
Divine revelation, fail to detect like omissions and
blemishes in the ethics of the New Testament. Thus,
though there is hardly a precept of Jesus Christ,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the like of which cannot be found in the ethical
writings of Greece, China, India, or Persia, the faultlessness
and completeness of his teachings give them
a position by themselves, and are among the strongest
internal evidences of their divinity. They are also
distinguished from the ethical systems of other teachers
by their positiveness. Others say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
not;”</span> Jesus Christ says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt.”</span> They forbid
and prohibit; He commands. They prescribe
abstinence from evil; He, a constant approach to
perfection. Buddhism is, in our time, often referred
to as occupying a higher plane than Christianity;
but its precepts are all negative, its virtues are negative,
and its disciple is deemed most nearly perfect,
when in body, mind, and soul he has made himself
utterly quiescent and inert. Christianity, on the
other hand, enjoins the unresting activity of all the
powers and faculties in pursuit of the highest ends.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the things that are fitting and right, there are
some which, though they may be described in
general terms, cannot be defined and limited with entire
accuracy; there are others which are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">so obvious
and manifest, or so easily ascertained</span></span>, that, in precise
form and measure, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">they may be claimed</span></span> by those
to whom they are due, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">and required</span></span> of those from
whom they are due. These last are rights, and the
duties which result from them are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">obligations</span></span>. Thus
it is right that a poor man should be relieved; and it
is my duty, so far as I can, to relieve the poor. But
this or that individual poor man cannot claim that it
is my duty rather than that of my neighbor to minister
to his needs, or that I am bound to give him
what I might otherwise give to his equally needy
neighbor. He has no specific right to any portion of
my money or goods; I have no specific obligation to
give him anything. But if a man has lent me
money, he has a right to as much of my money or
goods as will repay him with interest; and I am
under an obligation thus to repay him. Again, it is
right that in the public highway there should be,
among those who make it their thoroughfare, mutual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accommodation, courtesy, and kindness; but no one
man can prescribe the precise distance within which
he shall not be approached, or the precise amount of
pressure which may be allowable to his abutters in a
crowd. Nor yet can the individual citizen occupy the
street in such a way as to obstruct those who make
use of it. He has no exclusive rights in the street;
nor are others under obligation to yield to him any
peculiar privileges. But he has a right to exclude
whom he will from his own garden, and to occupy it
in whatever way may please him best; and his fellow-citizens
are under obligation to keep their feet from
his alleys and flower-beds, their hands from his fruit,
and to abstain from all acts that may annoy or injure
him in the use and enjoyment of his garden.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Rights</span></span>—with the corresponding obligations—might
be divided into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">natural</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">legal</span></span>. But the
division is nominal rather than real; for, in the first
place, there are no natural rights, capable of being
defined, which are not in civilized countries under
the sanction and protection of law; secondly, it is
an open question whether some generally recognized
rights—as, for instance, that of property—exist independently
of law; and, thirdly, it may be maintained,
on the other hand, that law is powerless to
create, competent only to declare rights.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One chief agency of law as to rights is exercised in
limiting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">natural rights</span></span>. Considered simply in his
relation to outward nature, a man has a manifest
right to whatever he can make tributary to his enjoyment
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or well-being. But his fellow-men have the
same right. If, then, there be a restricted supply of
what he and they may claim by equal right, the alternative
is, on the one hand, usurpation or perpetual
strife, or, on the other, an adjustment by which each
shall yield a part of what he might claim were there
no fellow-claimant, and thus each shall have his proportion
of what belongs equally to all. To make this
adjustment equitably is the province of law. The
problem which it attempts to solve is, How may each
individual citizen secure the fullest amount of liberty
and of material well-being, consistent with the admitted
or established rights of others? Under republican
institutions, this problem presents itself in the
simplest form, society being in principle an equal
partnership, in which no one man can claim a larger
dividend than another. But where birth or condition
confers certain peculiar rights, the problem must
be so modified, that the rights conceded to the common
citizens shall not interfere with these inherited
or vested rights. In either case, the rights of each
member of the community are bounded only by the
conterminous rights of others. Obligations correspond
to rights. Each member of the community is
under obligation, always to refrain from encroachment
on the rights of others, and in many cases to aid in
securing or defending those rights, he on like occasions
and in similar ways having his own rights protected
by others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will consider separately <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">rights appertaining
to the person, to property, and to reputation</span></span>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Rights appertaining to the person.</span></span> The most
essential of these is the right to life, on which of
course all else that can be enjoyed is contingent.
This right is invaded, not only by direct violence, but
by whatever may impair or endanger health. The
corresponding obligation of the individual member of
society is to refrain from all acts, employments, or
recreations that may imperil life or health, and of
society collectively, to furnish a police-force adequate
to the protection of its members, to forbid and punish
all crimes of violence, to enact and maintain proper
sanitary regulations, and to suppress such nuisances
as may be not only annoying, but harmful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the citizen is entitled to protection, only so
long as he refrains from acts by which he puts other
lives in peril. If he assault another man with a
deadly weapon, and his own life be taken in the encounter,
the slayer has violated no right, nay, so far
as moral considerations are concerned, he is not even
the slayer; for the man who wrongfully puts himself
in a position in which another life can be protected
only at the peril of his own, if his own be forfeited,
has virtually committed suicide. Nor is the case materially
altered, if a man in performing an unlawful
act puts himself in a position in which he may be
reasonably supposed to intend violence. Thus, while
both law and conscience would condemn me if I
killed a thief in broad daylight, in order to protect
my property,—if a burglar enter my house by night
with no intention of violence, and yet in the surprise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and darkness of the hour I have reason to suppose
my life and the lives of my family in danger from
him, the law regards my slaying of such a person as
justifiable homicide; and my conscience would acquit
me in defending the right to life appertaining to my
family and myself, against one whose intention or
willingness to commit violence was to be reasonably
inferred from his own unlawful act.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Society, through the agency of law, in some cases
and directions limits the right of the individual
citizen to life, and this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">to the contingent benefit
of each,—to the absolute benefit of all</span></span>. So long
as men are less than perfect in character and condition,
there must of necessity be some sacrifice of
life; but this sacrifice may be reduced to its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum</span></span>
by judicious legislation. Now, if without such
legislation the percentage of deaths would be numerically
much higher than under well-framed laws, the
lives sacrificed under these laws are simply cases in
which the right of the individual is made to yield to
the paramount rights of the community. Thus, there
can be no doubt, that contagious disease of the most
malignant type could, in many cases, be more successfully
treated at the homes of the patients than in
public hospitals. But if by the removal of patients
to hospitals the number of cases may be greatly
diminished, and the contagion speedily arrested, this
removal is the right of the community,—yet not under

It is only on similar grounds that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">death-penalty
for murder</span></span> can be justified. The life of the very
worst of men should be sacrificed only for the preservation
of life; for if it be unsafe to leave them at
liberty, they may be kept under restraint and duress,
without being wholly cut off from the means of
enjoyment and improvement. The primeval custom
of the earlier nations required the nearest kinsman
of the murdered man to kill the murderer with his
own hand, and in so doing to shed his blood, which
was believed to have a mysterious efficacy in expiating
the crime. This form of revenge was greatly
checked and restricted by the institutions of Moses;
it fell into disuse among the Jews, with their growth
in civilization; and was certainly included in the entire
repeal of the law of retaliation by Jesus Christ.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>

But if with the dangerous classes of men the dread
of capital punishment is a dissuasive from crimes of
violence, so that the number of murders is less, and
the lives of peaceable citizens are safer, than were
murder liable to some milder penalty, then it is the
undoubted right of the public to confiscate the murderer's
right to life, and thus to sacrifice the smaller
number of comparatively worthless lives for the security
of the larger number of lives that may be valuable
to the community. Or again if, by the profligate use
of the pardoning power, the murderer sentenced to
perpetual imprisonment will probably be let loose
upon society unreformed, and with passions which
may lead to the repetition of his crime, it is immeasurably
more fitting that he be killed, than that he
be preserved to do farther mischief. Yet again, if
there be in the death-penalty for murder an educational
force,—if by means of it each new generation
is trained in the greater reverence for human life,
and the greater detestation and horror of the crime
by which it is destroyed,—then is capital punishment
to be retained as a means of preserving an incalculably
greater number of lives than it sacrifices.
On these grounds, though in opposition to early and
strong conviction, we are constrained to express the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
belief that, in our time and country, the capital punishment
of the murderer is needed for the security of
the public, and is justified as a life-saving measure.

In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">enforced military service</span></span>, also, legal authority
exposes the lives of a portion of the citizens for the
security of the greater number. It is an unquestionable
truth that, in its moral affinities, war is generated
by evil, is allied to numberless forms of evil,
and has a countless progeny of evil. But it is equally
true that war will recur at not unfrequent intervals,
so long as the moral evils from which it springs
remain unreformed. Such are the complications of
international affairs, that the most righteous and
pacific policy may not always shield a people from
hostile aggressions; while insurrection, sedition, and
civil war may result not only from governmental
oppression, but from the most salutary measures of
reform and progress. In such cases, self-defence on
the part of the nation or the government assailed, is
a right and an obligation, due even in the interest
of human life, and still more, in behalf of interests
more precious than life. Moreover, even in a war of
unprovoked aggression, the aggressive nation does
not forfeit the right of self-defence by the unprincipled
ambition of its rulers, and, war once declared,
its vigorous pursuit may be the only mode of averting
disaster or ruin. Thus war, though always involving
atrocious wrong on the part of its promoters and
abettors, becomes to the nations involved in it a
necessity for which they are compelled to provide.

This provision may, in some cases, be made by voluntary
enlistment; but in most civilized countries, it
has been found necessary to fill and recruit the army
by conscription, thus forcibly endangering the lives of
a portion of the citizens, in order to avert from the
soil and the homes of the people at large the worse
calamities of invasion, devastation, and conquest. So
far as this is necessary, it is undoubtedly right, and
the lives thus sacrificed are justly due to the safety
and well-being of the whole people. But in making
this admission, we would say, without abatement or
qualification, that war is essentially inhuman, barbarous,
and opposed to and by the principles and
spirit of Christianity, and that should the world ever
be thoroughly Christianized, the ages when war was
possible, will be looked back upon with the same
horror with which we now regard cannibalism.

to express his own opinions orally, in writing, or

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">immature</span></span> judgment and discretion, of their natural
state of dependence on parents, and of their usual
abode under the parental roof. The age of mature
discretion varies very widely, not only in different
races, but among different individuals of the same
race, as does also the period of emancipation from the
controlling influence of parents, and of an independent
and self-sustaining condition in life. But, as it
is impossible for government to institute special inquiries
in the case of each individual, and as, were
this possible, there would be indefinite room for
favoritism and invidious distinctions, there is an intrinsic
fitness in fixing an average age at which parental
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quasi</span></span>-parental tutelage shall cease, and after
which the man shall have full and sole responsibility
for his own acts. It is perfectly obvious that the liberty

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a provision by which notorious spendthrifts may

not of revenge, but of self-defence. The design
of this mode of punishment is, first, to prevent the
speedy repetition of the crime on the part of the person
punished; secondly, so to work, either upon his
moral nature by confinement, labor, and instruction,
or at the worst, on his fears, by the dread of repeated
and longer restraint, that he may abstain from crime
in future; and lastly, to deter those who might otherwise
be tempted to crime from exposing themselves

he has justly forfeited the right to liberty by employing

As regards acts not in themselves wrong, the
freedom of the individual is rightfully restrained,
when it would interfere with the health, comfort, or
lawful pursuits of his neighbors. Thus no man has
the right, either legal or moral, to establish, in an inhabited
vicinage, a trade or manufacture which confessedly
poisons the air or the water in his neighborhood;
nor has one a moral right (even if there are
technical difficulties in the way of declaring his calling
a nuisance), to annoy his neighbors by an avocation

grossly offensive or intolerably noisy. It is on
this ground alone that legislation with reference to
the Lord's day can be justified. Christians have no
right to impose upon Jews, Pagans, or infidels, entire
cessation of labor, business, or recreation on Sunday,
and the attempt at coercive measures of this kind can
only react to the damage of the cause in which they
are instituted. But if the majority of the people believe
it their duty to observe the first day of the week
as a day of rest and devotion, they have a right to
be protected in its observance by the suppression of
such kinds, degrees, and displays of labor and recreation
as would essentially interfere with their employment
of the day for its sacred uses.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The right to property</span></span> is an inevitable corollary
from the right to liberty; for this implies freedom to
labor at one's will, and to what purpose can a man
labor, unless he can make the fruit of his labor his
own? All property, except land, has been created
by labor. Except where slavery is legalized, it is admitted
that the laborer owns the value he creates.
If it be an article made or produced wholly by himself,
it is his to keep, to use, to give, or to sell. If
his labor be bestowed on materials not his own, or if
he be one of a body of workmen, he is entitled to a
fair equivalent for the labor he contributes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Property in land</span></span>, no doubt, originated in labor.
A man was deemed the proprietor of so much ground
as he tilled. In a sparse population there could have
been no danger of mutual interference; and in every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
country, governments must have been instituted before
there was a sufficiently close occupation of the
soil to occasion collisions and conflicts among the occupants.
The governments of the early ages, in general,
confirmed the titles founded in productive occupancy,
and treated the unoccupied land as the property
of the state, either to be held in common, to be
ceded to individual owners in reward of loyalty or
services, or to be sold on the public account.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is manifest that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">security of property is
essential to civilization and progress</span></span>. Men would
labor only for the needs of the day, if they could not
retain and enjoy the fruits of their labor; nor would
they be at pains to invent or actualize industrial improvements
of any kind, if they had no permanent
interest in the results of such improvements. Then,
too, if there were no protection for property, there
could be no accumulation of capital, and without capital
there could be no enterprise, no combined industries,
no expenditure in faith of a remote, yet certain
profit. Nor yet can the ends of a progressive civilization
be answered by a community of goods and
gains. Wherever this experiment has been tried, it
has been attended by a decline of industrial energy
and capacity; and where there has not been absolute
failure, there have been apathy, stupidity, and
a decreasing standard of intelligence. In fine, there
is in man's bodily and mental powers a certain <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis
inertiæ</span></span>, which can be efficiently aroused only by the
stimulus of personal interest in the results of industry,
ingenuity, and prudence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The right of property implies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the right of the
owner, while he lives</span></span>, to hold, enjoy, or dispose of
his possessions in such way as may please him. But
his ownership necessarily ceases at death; and what
was his becomes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">rightfully the property of the public</span></span>.
Yet in all civilized countries, it has been deemed
fitting that the owner should have the liberty—with
certain restrictions—of dictating the disposal of his
property after his death, and also that, unless alienated
by his will (and in some countries his will notwithstanding),
his property should pass to his family
or his nearest kindred. It is believed that it would
discourage industry and enfeeble enterprise were
their earnings to be treated as public property on the
death of the owner; and that, on the other hand,
men are most surely trained to and preserved in
habits of diligence and thrift, either by the power of
directing the disposal of their property after death,
or by the certainty that they can thereby benefit
those whom they hold in the dearest regard. Laws
with reference to wills and to the succession of
estates are not, then, limitations of the rights of private
property, but a directory as to what is deemed
the best mode of disposing of such property as from
time to time accrues to the public.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The law limits the right of property</span></span> by appropriating
to public uses such portions of it as are
needed for the maintenance, convenience, and well-being
of the body politic. This is done, in the first
place, by taxation, which—in order to be just—must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be equitable in its mode of assessment, and not
excessive in amount. As to the modes of assessment,
it is obvious that a system which lightens the burden
upon the rich, and thus presses the more heavily
on the poor (as would be the case were a revenue
raised on the necessaries of life, while luxuries were
left free), cannot be justified. On the other hand, it
may be maintained that the rate of taxation might
fairly increase with the amount of property; for a
very large proportion of the machinery of government
is designed for the protection of property, and
the more property an individual has, the less capable
is he of protecting his various interests by his own
personal care, and the more is he in need of well-devised
and faithfully executed laws. Taxation excessive
in amount is simply legalized theft. Sinecures,
supernumerary offices, needless and costly formalities
in the transaction of public business, journeys and
festivities at the public charge, buildings designed for
ostentation rather than for use, have been so long tolerated
in the municipal, state, and national administrations,
that they may seem inseparable from our
system of government; but they imply gross dishonesty
on the part of large numbers of our public servants,
and guilty complicity in it on the part of many
more. Under a system of direct taxation, assessments
can be more equitably made, and their expenditure
will be more carefully watched, than in the case
of indirect taxation; while the latter method is more
likely to find favor with those who hold or seek public
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
office, as encouraging a larger freedom of expenditure,
and supporting a larger number of needless
functionaries at the public cost.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The law, also, authorizes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the appropriation of
specific portions of property to public uses</span></span>, as
for streets, roads, aqueducts, and public grounds, and
even in aid of private enterprises in which the community
has a beneficial interest, as of canals, bridges,
and railways. This is necessary, and therefore right.
It is obvious that, but for this, the most essential
facilities and improvements might be prevented, or
burdened with unreasonable costs, by the obstinacy or
cupidity of individuals. The conditions under which
such use of private property is justified are, that the
improvement proposed be for the general good, that a
fair compensation be given for the property taken,
and that as to both these points, in case of a difference
of opinion, the ultimate appeal shall be to an
impartial tribunal or arbitration.

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The right to reputation.</span></span> Every man has a
right to the reputation he deserves, and is under
obligation to respect that right in every other man.
This obligation is violated, not only by the fabrication
of slander, but equally by its repetition, unless
the person who repeats it knows it to be true, and
also by silence and seeming acquiescence in an injurious
report, if one knows or believes it to be false.
But has a man a right to a better reputation than he
deserves? Certainly not, in a moral point of view;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and if men could be generally known to be what they
are, few would fail to become what they would wish
to seem. Yet the law admits the truth of a slanderous
charge in justification of the slanderer, only when
it can be shown that the knowledge of the truth is for
the public benefit. There are good reasons for this
attitude of the law, without reference to any supposed
rights of the justly accused party. There is, in many
instances, room for a reasonable doubt as to evil reports
that seem authentic, and in many more instances
there may be extenuating circumstances which
form a part of the case, though almost never, of the
report. Then, too, the family and kindred of the
person defamed may incur, through true, yet useless
reports to his discredit, shame, annoyance, and damage,
which they do not merit. Evil reports, also,
even if true, disturb the peace of the community, and
often provoke violent retaliation. The wanton circulation
of them, therefore, if a luxury to him who
gives them currency, is a luxury indulged at the expense
of the public, and he ought to be held liable
for all that it may cost. Finally, and above all, the
slanderer becomes a nuisance to the community, not
only by his reports of real or imagined wrong and
evil, but by the degradation of his own character,
which can hardly remain above the level of his social
intercourse.

The appetites, desires, and affections are, as has
been said, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">proximate motives</span></span> of action.
The perception of expediency and the sense of right
act, not independently of these motives, but upon
them and through them, checking some, stimulating
others. Thus they, both, restrain the appetites, the
former, so far as prudence requires; the latter, in subserviency
to the more noble elements of character.
The former directs the desires toward worthy, but
earthly objects; the latter works most efficiently
through the benevolent affections, as exercised toward
God and man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Exterior motives are of a secondary order, acting
not directly upon the will, but influencing it indirectly,
through the springs of action, or through the principles
which direct and govern them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The action of exterior motives</span></span> takes place in
three different ways. 1. When they are in harmony
with any predominant appetite, desire, or affection,
they at once intensify it, and prompt acts by which
it may be gratified. Thus, for instance, a sumptuously
spread table gives the epicure a keener appetite,
and invites him to its free indulgence. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opportunity of a potentially lucrative, though hazardous
investment, excites the cupidity of the man who
prizes money above all things else, and tempts him to
incur the doubtful risk. The presence of the object
of love or hatred adds strength to the affection, and
induces expressions or acts of kindness or malevolence.
2. An exterior motive opposed to the predominant
spring of action often starts that spring into vigorous
and decisive activity, and makes it thenceforth
stronger and more imperative. It is thus that remonstrances,
obstacles, and interposing difficulties not infrequently
render sensual passion more rabid; while
temptation, by the acts of resistance which it elicits,
nourishes the virtue it assails. 3. An exterior motive
may have a sufficient stress and cogency to call forth
into energetic action some appetite, desire, or affection
previously dormant or feeble, thus to repress the
activity of those which before held sway, and so to
produce a fundamental change in the character. In
this way the sudden presentation of vice, in attractive
forms, may give paramount sway to passions which
had previously shown no signs of mastery; and, in
like manner, a signal experience of peril, calamity,
deliverance, or unexpected joy may call forth the
religious affections, and invest them with enduring
supremacy over a soul previously surrendered to appetite,
inferior desires, or meaner loves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">An undue influence</span></span> in the formation or change
of character <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">is often ascribed to exterior motives.</span></span>
They are oftener the consequence than the cause of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
character. Men, in general, exercise more power over
their surroundings, than their surroundings over them.
A very large proportion of the circumstances which
seem to have a decisive influence upon us, are of our
own choice, and we might—had we so willed—have
chosen their opposites. A virtuous person seldom
finds it necessary to breathe a vicious atmosphere. A
willingness to be tempted is commonly the antecedent
condition to one's being led into temptation. Sympathy,
example, and social influences are second in
their power, whether for good or for evil, to no other
class of exterior motives; and there are few who cannot
choose their own society, and who do not choose
it in accordance with their elective affinities. It is
true, indeed, that the choice of companions of doubtful
virtue is often the first outward sign of vicious proclivities;
while a tenacious adherence to the society
of the most worthy not infrequently precedes any
very conspicuous development of personal excellence;
but in either case the choice of friends indicates the
predominant springs of action, and the direction in
which the character has begun to grow. So far then
is man from being under the irresistible control of
motives from without, that these motives are in great
part the results and the tokens of his own voluntary
agency.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity justly claims preëminence, not only
as a source of knowledge as to the right, but equally
as presenting the most influential and persistent
motives to right conduct. These motives we have in

its endearing and winning manifestation of the Divine
fatherhood by Jesus Christ; in his own sacrifice,
death, and undying love for man; in the assurance
of forgiveness for past wrongs and omissions,
without which there could be little courage for future
well-doing; in the promise of Divine aid in every
right purpose and worthy endeavor; in the certainty
of a righteous retribution in the life to come; and in
institutions and observances designed and adapted to
perpetuate the memory of the salient facts, and to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">renew</span></span> at frequent intervals the recognition of the
essential truths, which give the religion its name and
character. The desires and affections, stimulated and
directed by these motives, are incapable of being perverted
to evil, while desires with lower aims and
affections for inferior objects are always liable to be
thus perverted. These religious motives, too, resting
on the Infinite and the Eternal, are of inexhaustible
power; if felt at all, they must of necessity be felt
more strongly than all other motives; and they cannot
fail to be adequate to any stress of need, temptation,
or trial.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it are the results of unreasoning impulse, and in the
unreal and distorted views which it presents of persons,
objects, and events. It differs from insanity,
mainly in its being a self-induced madness, for which,
as for drunkenness, the sufferer is morally accountable,
and in yielding to which, as in drunkenness, he,
by suffering his will to pass beyond the control of
reason, makes himself responsible, both legally and
morally, for whatever crimes or wrongs he commits in
this state of mental alienation.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">There is no appetite, desire, or affection which
may not become a passion</span></span>, and there is no passion
which does not impair the sense of right, and interfere
with the discharge of duty. The appetites, the
lower desires, the malevolent affections, and, not
infrequently, love, when they become passions, have
their issues in vice and crime. The nobler desires and
affections when made passions, may not lead to positive
evil, but can hardly fail to derange the fitting
order of life, and to result in the dereliction of some of
its essential duties. Thus, the passion for knowledge
may render one indifferent to his social and religious
obligations. Philanthropy, when a passion, overlooks
nearer for more remote claims of duty, and is very
prone to omit self-discipline and self-culture in its zeal
for world-embracing charities. Even the religious
affections, when they assume the character of passions,
either, on the one hand, are kindled into wild
fanaticism, or, on the other, lapse into a self-absorbed
quietism, which forgets outside duties in the luxury of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
devout contemplation; and though either of these is
to be immeasurably preferred to indifference, they
both are as immeasurably inferior to that piety,
equally fervent and rational, which neglects neither
man for God, nor God for man, and which remains
mindful of all human and earthly relations, fitnesses,
and duties, while at the same time it retains its hold
of faith, hope, and habitual communion, on the higher
life.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Habit</span></span> also involves the suspension of reason and
motive in the performance of individual acts; but it
differs from passion in that its acts were in the beginning
prompted by reason and motive. Indeed, it
may be plausibly maintained that in each habitual act
there is a virtual remembrance—a recollection too
transient to be itself remembered—of the reasoning
or motive which induced the first act of the series. In
some cases the habitual act is performed, as it is said,
unconsciously, certainly with a consciousness so evanescent
as to leave no trace of itself. In other cases the
act is performed consciously, but as by a felt necessity,
in consequence of an uneasy sensation—analogous to
hunger and thirst—which can be allayed in this way
only. Under this last head we may class, in the first
place, habits of criminal indulgence, including the indulgence
of morbid and depraved appetite; secondly,
many of those morally indifferent habits, which constitute
a large portion of a regular and systematic life;
and thirdly, habits of virtuous conduct, of industry,
of punctuality, of charity.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Habit bears a most momentous part in the formation
and growth of character</span></span>, whether for evil or
for good. It is in the easy and rapid formation of
habit that lies the imminent peril of single acts of
vicious indulgence. The first act is performed with
the determination that it shall be the last of its kind.
But of all examples one's own is that which he is
most prone to follow, and of all bad examples one's
own is the most dangerous. The precedent once
established, there is the strongest temptation to repeat
it, still with a conscious power of self-control, and
with the resolution to limit the degree and to arrest
the course of indulgence, so as to evade the ultimate
disgrace and ruin to which it tends. But before the
pre-determined limit is reached, the indulgence has
become a habit; its suspension is painful; its continuance
or renewal seems essential to comfortable existence;
and even in those ultimate stages when its very
pleasure has lapsed into satiety, and then into wretchedness,
its discontinuance threatens still greater
wretchedness, because the craving is even more intense
when the enjoyment has ceased.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The beneficent agency of habit no less deserves
emphatic notice.</span></span> Its office in practical morality is
analogous to that of labor-saving inventions in the
various departments of industry. A machine by
which ten men can do the work that has been done
by thirty, disengages the twenty for new modes of
productive labor, and thus augments the products of
industry and the comfort of the community. A good
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
habit is a labor-saving instrument. The cultivating
of any specific virtue to such a degree that it shall
become an inseparable and enduring element of the
character demands, at the outset, vigilance, self-discipline,
and, not infrequently, strenuous effort. But
when the exercise of that virtue has become habitual,
and therefore natural, easy, and essential to one's conscious
well-being, it ceases to task the energies; it no
longer requires constant watchfulness; its occasions
are met spontaneously by the appropriate dispositions
and acts. The powers which have been employed in
its culture are thus set free for the acquisition of yet
other virtues, and the formation of other good habits.
Herein lies the secret of progressive goodness, of an
ever nearer approach to a perfect standard of character.
The primal virtues are first made habits of
the unceasing consciousness and of the daily life, and
the moral power no longer needed for these is then
employed in the cultivation of the finer traits of superior
excellence,—the shaping of the delicate lines,
roundings, and proportions, which constitute "the
beauty of holiness," the symmetry and grace of character
that win not only abounding respect and confidence,
but universal admiration and love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">What has been said of habit, is true not only as to
outward acts, but equally as to wonted directions and
currents of thought, study, reflection, and reverie.</span></span>
It is mainly through successive stages of habit that
the mind grows in its power of application, research,
and invention. It is thus that the spirit of devotion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is trained to ever clearer realization of sacred truth and
a more fervent love and piety. It is thus that minds
of good native capacity lose their apprehensive faculties
and their working power; and thus, also, that
moral corruption often, no doubt, takes place before
the evil desires cherished within find the opportunity
of actualizing themselves in a depraved life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The term virtue</span></span> is employed in various senses,
which, though they cover a wide range, are yet
very closely allied to one another, and to the initial
conception in which they all have birth. Its primitive
signification, as its structure<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
indicates, is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">manliness</span></span>.
Now what preëminently distinguishes, not so much
the human race from the lower animals, as the full-grown
and strong man from the feebler members of
his own race, is the power of resolute, strenuous, persevering
conflict and resistance. It is the part of
a man worthy of the name to maintain his own position,
to hold his ground against all invaders, to show
a firm front against all hostile force, and to prefer
death to conquest. All this is implied in the Greek
and Roman idea of virtue, and is included in the Latin
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtus</span></span>,
when it is used with reference to military
transactions, so that its earliest meaning was, simply,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">military prowess</span></span>. But with the growth of ethical
philosophy, and especially with the cultivation by the
Stoics of the sterner and hardier traits of moral excellence,
men learned that there was open to them a
more perilous battle-ground, a severer conflict, and a
more glorious victory, than in mere physical warfare,—that
there was a higher type of manliness in self-conquest,
in the resistance and subdual of appetite
and passion, in the maintenance of integrity and
purity under intense temptation and amidst vicious
surroundings, than in the proudest achievements of
military valour. Virtue thus came to mean, not
moral goodness in itself considered, but goodness militant
and triumphant.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">words which have a complex signification
always tend to slough off a part of their meaning</span></span>;
and, especially, words that denote a state or property,
together with its mode of growth or of manifestation,
are prone to drop the latter, even though it may have
given them root and form. Thus the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">virtue</span></span> is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
often used to denote the qualities that constitute
human excellence, without direct reference to the conflict
with evil, whence it gets its name, and in which
those qualities have their surest growth and most conspicuous
manifestation. There is still, however, a
tacit reference to temptation and conflict in our use of
the term. Though we employ it to denote goodness
that has stood no very severe test, we use it
only where such a test may be regarded as possible.
Though we call a man virtuous who has been shielded
from all corrupt examples and influences, and has had
no inducements to be otherwise than good, we do not
apply the epithet to the little child who cannot by
any possibility have been exposed to temptation.
Nor yet would we apply it to the perfect purity and
holiness of the Supreme Being, who <span class="tei tei-q">“cannot be
tempted with evil.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Virtue then, in its more usual sense at the present
time, denotes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">conduct in accordance with the right</span></span>,
or with the fitness of things, on the part of one who has
the power to do otherwise. But in this sense there
are few, if any, perfectly virtuous men. There are,
perhaps, none who are equally sensitive to all that the
right requires, and it is often the deficiencies of a character
that give it its reputation for distinguished excellence
in some one form of virtue, the vigilance, self-discipline,
and effort which might have sustained the
character in a well-balanced mediocrity being so concentrated
upon some single department of duty as to
excite high admiration and extended praise. There
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may be a deficient sensitiveness to some classes of obligations,
while yet there is no willing or conscious violation
of the right, and in such cases the character must
be regarded as virtuous. But if in any one department
of duty a person is consciously false to his sense
of right, even though in all other respects he conforms
to the right, he cannot be deemed virtuous, nor can
there be any good ground for assurance that he may
not, with sufficient inducement, violate the very obligations
which he now holds in the most faithful regard.
This is what is meant by that saying of St.
James, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and
yet offend in one point, is guilty of all,”</span>—not that
he who commits a single offence through inadvertency
or sudden temptation, is thus guilty; but he who
willingly and deliberately violates the right as to
matters in which he is the most strongly tempted to
wrong and evil, shows an indifference to the right
which will lead him to observe it only so long and so
far as he finds it convenient and easy so to do.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here we are naturally led to inquire whether there is
any essential <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">connection between virtue and piety</span></span>,—between
the faithful discharge of the common
duties of life and loving loyalty toward the Supreme
Being. On this subject extreme opinions have been
held, sceptics and unbelievers, on the one side, Christians
with a leaven of antinomianism on the other,
maintaining the entire independence of virtue on
piety; while Christians of the opposite tendency have
represented them, in spite of ample evidence to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contrary, as inseparable. We shall find, on examination,
that they are separable and independent, yet
auxiliary each to the other. Virtue is conduct in accordance
with the right, and we have seen that right
and wrong, as moral distinctions, depend not on the
Divine nature, will or law,<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> but on the inherent,
necessary conditions of being. The atheist cannot
escape or disown them. Whatever exists—no matter
how it came into being—must needs have its due
place, affinities, adaptations, and uses. An intelligent
dweller among the things that are, cannot but know
something of their fitnesses and harmonies, and so far
as he acts upon them cannot but feel the obligation
to recognize their fitnesses, and thus to create or restore
their harmonies. Even to the atheist, vice is a
violation of fitnesses which he knows or may know.
It is opposed to his conscientious judgment. He has
with regard to it an inevitable sense of wrong. We
can, therefore, conceive of an atheist's being rigidly
virtuous, and that on principle. Though among the
ancient Stoics there were some eminently devout men,
there were others, men of impregnable virtue, whose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
theology was too vague and meagre to furnish either
ground or nourishment for piety. While, therefore,
in the mutual and reciprocal fitnesses that pervade
the universe we find demonstrative evidence of the
being, unity, and moral perfectness of the Creator, we
are constrained to acknowledge the possibility of these
fitnesses being recognized in the conduct of life by
those who do not follow them out to the great truths
of theology to which they point and lead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, on the other hand, where there is a clear
knowledge of, or an undoubting belief in the being
and providence of God, and especially for persons
who receive Christianity as a revelation of the truth,
though, as an affection, piety is independent of virtue,
the duties of piety are an essential part of virtue.
If God is, we stand in definable relations to Him, and
those relations are made definite through Christianity.
Those relations have their fitnesses, and we see not
how he can be a thoroughly virtuous man, who, discerning
these fitnesses with the understanding, fails
to recognize them in conduct. Conscience can take
cognizance only of the fitnesses which the individual
man knows or believes; but it does take cognizance
of all the fitnesses which he knows or believes. Virtue
may coexist with a very low standard of emotional
piety; but it cannot coexist, in one who believes the
truths of religion, with blasphemy, irreverence, or the
conscious violation or neglect of religious obligations.
He who is willingly false to his relations with the
Supreme Being, needs only adequate temptation to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
make him false to his human relations, and to the fitnesses
of his daily life. Moreover, while, as we have
said, virtue may exist where there is but little emotional
piety, virtue can hardly fail to cherish piety.
Loyalty of conduct deepens loyalty of spirit; obedience
nourishes love; he who faithfully does the will of God
can hardly fail to become worshipful and devout; and
while men are more frequently led by emotional piety
to virtue, there can be no doubt that with many the
process is reversed, and virtue leads to emotional
piety. Then again, we have seen that religion supplies
the most efficient of all motives to a virtuous
life,—motives adequate to a stress of temptation and
trial which suffices to overpower and neutralize all
inferior motives.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Virtue is one and indivisible in its principle and
essence, yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">in its external manifestations presenting
widely different aspects</span></span>, and eliciting a
corresponding diversity in specific traits of character.
Thus, though intrinsic fitness be equally the rule of
conduct at a pleasure-party and by a pauper's bed-side,
the conduct of the virtuous man will be widely
different on these two occasions; and not only so, but
with the same purpose of fidelity to what is fitting and
right, his dispositions, aims, and endeavors on these
two occasions will have little or nothing in common
except the one pervading purpose. Hence virtue may
under different forms assume various names, and may
thus be broken up into separate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">virtues</span></span>. These are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
many or few, according as we distribute in smaller or
larger groups the occasions for virtuous conduct, or
analyze with greater or less minuteness the sentiments
and dispositions from which it proceeds.

are other less salient and essential qualities—minor
virtues—the possession of which adds to the symmetry,
beauty, and efficiency of the character, but which
one may lack, and yet none the less deserve to be regarded
as a virtuous man. Thus, justice is a cardinal
virtue; gentleness, one of the lesser rank.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We propose to adopt as a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">division of the virtues</span></span>
one which recognizes four cardinal virtues, corresponding
to four classes under which may be comprehended
all the fitnesses of man's condition in this
world, and the duties proceeding from them respectively.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
There are fitnesses and duties appertaining,
first, to one's own being, nature, capacities, and needs;
secondly, to his relations to his fellow-beings; thirdly,
to his disposition and conduct with reference to external
objects and events beyond his control; and
fourthly, to his arrangement, disposal, and use of objects
under his control. It is difficult to find names
which in their common use comprehend severally all
the contents of each of these four divisions; but yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they are all comprised within the broadest significance
of the terms Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Order.
Thus employed, Prudence, or providence, includes
all the duties of self-government and self-culture;
Justice denotes all that is due to God and man,
embracing piety and benevolence; Fortitude, which
is but a synonyme for strength, is an appropriate general
name for every mode, whether of defiance, resistance,
or endurance, in which man shows himself superior
to his inevitable surroundings; and Order is
extended to all subjects in which the question of duty
is a question of time, place, or measure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">We can conceive of no right feeling, purpose,

these heads.</span></span> It is obvious, too, that these are all
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cardinal</span></span> virtues, not one of which could be wanting
or grossly deficient in a virtuous man. For, in the
first place, he who omits were it only the duties of
self-culture, and thus leaves himself ignorant of what
he ought to know, takes upon himself the full burden,
blame, and penalty of whatever wrong he may commit
in consequence of needless ignorance; secondly,
he who is willingly unfaithful in any of his relations
to God or man, cannot by any possibility be worthy
of approbation; nor, thirdly, can he be so, who is the
slave, not the master, of his surroundings; while,
fourthly, fitnesses of time, place, and measure are so
essential to right-doing that the violation of them
renders what else were right, wrong.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">each of these four virtues</span></span>, if genuine

and highly developed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">implies the presence of all
the others</span></span>. 1. There is a world of wisdom in the
question asked in the Hebrew Scriptures: <span class="tei tei-q">“Have all
the workers of iniquity no knowledge?”</span> There is in
all wrong-doing either ignorance, or temporary hallucination
or blindness, and imprudence is but ignorance
or delusion carried into action. Did we see
clearly the certain bearings and consequences of actions,
we should need no stronger dissuasive from all
evil, no more cogent motive to every form of virtue.
2. There is no conceivable duty which may not be
brought under the head of justice, either to God or
to man; for our duties to ourselves are due to God
who has ordained them, and to man whom we are
the more able to benefit, the more diligent we are
in self-government and self-improvement. 3. Our
wrong-doing of every kind comes from our yielding to
outward things instead of rising above them; and
he who truly lives above the world, can hardly fail to
do all that is right and good in it. 4. Perfect order—the
doing of everything in the right time, place,
and measure—would imply the presence of all the
virtues, and would include all their work.

Can there be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">duties to one's self</span></span>, which are of
absolute obligation? Duties are dues, and they
imply two parties,—one who owes them, and one to
whom they are due,—the debtor and the creditor.
But the creditor may, at his will, cancel the debt, and
release the debtor. In selfward duties, then, why
may I not, as creditor, release myself as debtor?
Why may I not—so long as I violate no obligation
to others—be, at my own pleasure, idle or industrious,
self-indulgent or abstinent, frivolous or serious?
Why, if life seem burdensome to me, may I
not relieve myself of the trouble of living? The
answer is, that to every object in the universe with
which I am brought into relation I owe its fit use,
and that no being in the universe, not even the Omnipotent,
can absolve me from this obligation. Now
my several powers and faculties, with reference to
my will, are objects on which my volitions take effect,
and I am bound to will their fit uses, and to abstain
from thwarting or violating those uses, on the same
ground on which I am bound to observe and reverence
the fitnesses of objects that form no part of my
personality. Moreover, this earthly life is, with reference

to my will, an object on which my volitions

fit uses, both in this world and in preparation for a
higher state of being, and that these uses are often
best served by the most painful events and experiences;
and I thus find myself bound to take the utmost
care of my life, even when it seems the least
worth caring for.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">uses of life</span></span>, both to ourselves, and to others
through us, suffice, as we have said, to render its preservation
a duty, enjoined upon us by the law of fitness.
This duty is violated not only by suicide—against
which it is useless to reason, for its victims in
modern Christendom are seldom of sound mind—but
equally by needless and wanton exposure to peril.
Such exposure is frequently incurred in reckless feats
of strength or daring, sometimes consummated in
immediate death, and still oftener in slower self-destruction
by disease. There are, no doubt, occasions
when self-preservation must yield to a higher
duty, and humanity has made no important stage of
progress without the free sacrifice of many noble
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lives; but because it may be a duty to give life in the
cause of truth or liberty, it by no means follows that
one has a right to throw it away for the gratification
of vanity, for a paltry wager, or to win the fame of
an accomplished athlete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The duty of self-preservation includes, of course,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">a reasonable care for health</span></span>, without which the uses
of life are essentially restricted and impaired. Here
a just mean must be sought and adhered to. There
is, on the one hand, an excessive care of the body,
which, if it does not enfeeble the mind, distracts it
from its true work, and makes the spiritual nature a
mere slave of the material organism. This solicitude
is sometimes so excessive as to defeat its own purpose,
by creating imaginary diseases, and then making them
real; and the number is by no means small of those
who have become chronic invalids solely by the pains
they have taken not to be so. On the other hand,
there is a carelessness as to dress and diet, to which
the strongest constitution must at length yield; and
the intense consciousness of strength and vigor, which
tempts one to deem himself invulnerable, not infrequently
is the cause of life-long infirmity and disability.
Of the cases of prolonged and enfeebling disease,
probably more are the result of avoidable than of unavoidable
causes, and if we add to these the numerous
instances in which the failure of health is to be ascribed
to hereditary causes which might have been
avoided, or to defective sanitary arrangements that
may be laid to the charge of the public, we have an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enormous amount of serviceable life needlessly wasted
for all purposes of active usefulness; while for the
precious examples of patience, resignation, and cheerful
endurance, the infirmities and sufferings incident
to the most favorable sanitary conditions might have
been amply sufficient.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, no doubt, such wide diversities of constitution
and temperament that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">no specific rules of
self-preservation can be laid down</span></span>; and as regards
diet, sleep, and exercise, habit may render the most
unlike methods and times equally safe and beneficial.
But wholesome food in moderate quantity, sleep long
enough for rest and refreshment, exercise sufficient to
neutralize the torpifying influence of sedentary pursuits,
and these, though not with slavish uniformity,
yet with a good degree of regularity, may be regarded
as essential to a sound working condition of body and
mind. The same may be said of the unstinted use of
water, which has happily become a necessity of high
civilization, of pure air, the worth of which as a sanitary
agent is practically ignored by the major part of
our community, and of the direct light of heaven, the
exclusion of which from dwellings from motives of
economy, while it may spare carpets and curtains,
wilts and depresses their owners. These topics are
inserted in a treatise on ethics, because whatever has
a bearing on health, and thus on the capacity for usefulness
selfward and manward which constitutes the
whole value of this earthly life, is of grave moral
significance. If the preservation of life is a duty,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then all hygienic precautions and measures are duties,
and as such they should be treated by the individual
moral agent, by parents, guardians, and teachers, and
by the public at large.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Self-preservation is endangered by poverty.</span></span> In
the lack or precariousness of the means of subsistence,
the health of the body is liable to suffer; and even
where there is not absolute want, but a condition
straitened in the present and doubtful as to the
future, the mind loses much of its working power,
and life is deprived of a large portion of its utility.
Hence the duty of industry and economy on the part
of those dependent on their own exertions. It is not
a man's duty to be rich, though he who in acquiring
wealth takes upon himself its due obligations and
responsibilities, is a public benefactor; but it is every
man's duty to shun poverty, if he can, and he who
makes or keeps himself poor by his own indolence,
thriftlessness, or prodigality, commits a sin against
his own life, which he curtails as to its capacity of
good, and against society, which has a beneficial interest
in the fully developed life of all its members.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Inasmuch as knowledge, real or supposed, must
needs precede every act of the will, and as the adaptation
of our actions to our purposes depends on the
accuracy of our knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">it is intrinsically fitting
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-weight: 700">
that our cognitive powers should be thoroughly
developed and trained, and diligently employed.</span></span>
Especially is this fitting, because—as has been already
shown—it is through knowledge alone that
we can bring our conduct into conformity with the
absolute right, and there is nothing within the range
of our possible knowledge, which may not become in
some way connected with our agency as moral beings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is of prime importance that what we seem to
know we know accurately; and as it is through the
senses that we acquire our knowledge, not only of the
outward objects with which we are daily conversant,
but of other minds than our own, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the education
of the senses</span></span> is an obvious duty. There are few so
prolific sources of social evil, injustice, and misery, as
the falsehood of persons who mean to tell the truth,
but who see or hear only in part, and supply the deficiencies
of perception by the imagination. In the
acquisition of knowledge of the highest interest and
importance this same hindrance is one of the most
frequent obstacles. The careless eye and the heedless
ear waste for many minds a large portion of the time
ostensibly given to serious pursuits, and render their
growth pitifully slow and scanty as compared with
their means of culture. The senses may, especially
in early life, be trained to alertness and precision, so
that they shall carry to the mind true and full reports
of what they see and hear; and it is only by such
training that the perceptive faculties can accomplish
the whole work for which they are designed and fitted.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, also, interior senses, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">apprehensive powers
of the mind</span></span>, which equally crave culture, and
which depend for their precision and force on careful
education and diligent use. Mere observation, experience,
or study, cannot give knowledge that will
be of any avail. One may have a largely and
variously stocked memory, and yet be unable to employ
its contents to his own advantage or to the benefit
of others. Indeed, there are minds that are paralyzed
by being overloaded,—by taking in freight
faster than they have room for it. It is only materials
which the mind has made its own, incorporated into
its substance, that it can fully utilize. Knowledge
must be acted upon by the understanding, the reason,
the judgment, before it can be transmuted into wisdom,
and employed either in the acquisition of new
truth or in the conduct of life. Mental activity, then,
is a duty; for if we are bound to preserve life, by
parity of reason, we are bound to improve its quality
and increase its quantity, and this cannot be done
unless the intellectual powers are strengthened by
diligent exercise, as well as nourished by the facts and
truths which are the raw material of wisdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fit <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">objects of knowledge</span></span> vary indefinitely
with one's condition in life. Things in themselves
trivial or evanescent may, under certain circumstances,
claim our careful attention and thorough cognizance.
We ought, on the one hand, to know all we can about
matters concerning which we must speak or act, and,
on the other hand, to refrain from voluntarily speaking
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or acting in matters of which we are ignorant.
Thus our social relations and our daily intercourse
may render it incumbent on us to obtain for current
use a large amount of accurate knowledge which is
not worth our remembering. Then a man's profession,
stated business, or usual occupation opens a large field
of knowledge, with which and with its allied provinces
it is his manifest duty to become conversant to his
utmost ability; for the genuineness and value of his
work must be in a great degree contingent on his
intelligence. At the same time, every man is bound
to make his profession worthy of respect; in failing
to do so, he wrongs and injures the members of his
profession collectively; and no calling can obtain respect,
if those who pursue it show themselves uncultivated
and ignorant. Thus far, then, should knowledge
be extended on grounds of practical utility.
Beyond and above this range, there is an unlimited
realm of truth, the knowledge of which is inestimably
precious for the higher culture of the mind and character.
In this realm, of which only an infinitesimal
portion can be conquered during an earthly lifetime,
there is no unfruitful region,—there is no department
of nature, of psychology, or of social science, through
which the mind may not be expanded, exalted, energized,
led into more intimate relations with the Supreme
Intelligence, endowed with added power of beneficent
agency. While, therefore, knowledge of things
as they are, and of their underlying principles and
laws, so far as we are able to acquire it, is not only a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
privilege beyond all price, but an absolute duty, there
are no moral considerations which need direct or limit
our choice of the themes of research or study. These
may properly be determined by native or acquired
proclivity, by opportunity, or by considerations of
usefulness. Nor, if the love of truth be formed and
cherished, can it of be of any essential importance
whether this or that portion of truth be pursued or
neglected during the brief period of our life in this
world; for, at best, what we leave unattained must
immeasurably exceed our attainments, and there is an
eternity before us for what we are compelled to omit
here. At the same time, the unbounded scope and
the vast diversity of things knowable and worthy to
be known are adapted to stimulate self-culture, and
in that same proportion to invest human life with a
higher dignity, a larger intrinsic value, and a more
enduring influence.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">A man must be either self-governed, or under
a worse government than his own.</span></span> God governs
men, only by teaching and helping them to govern
themselves. Good men, if also wise, seek not, even
for the highest ends, to control their fellow-men, but,
so far as they can, enable and encourage them to exercise
a due self-control. It is only unwise or bad
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men who usurp the government of other wills than
their own. But the individual will is oftener made
inefficient by passion, than by direct influence from
other minds. Man, in his normal state, wills either
what is expedient or what is right. Passion suspends,
as to its objects, all reference to expediency and
right, even when there is the clearest knowledge of
the tendencies of the acts to which it prompts. Thus
the sensualist often knows that he is committing sure
and rapid suicide, yet cannot arrest himself on the
declivity of certain ruin. The man in whom avarice
has become a passion is perfectly aware of the comforts
and enjoyments which he is sacrificing, yet is as
little capable of procuring them as if he were a pauper.
Anger and revenge not infrequently force men
to crimes which they know will be no less fatal to
themselves than to their victims. Now if a man will
not put and keep himself under the government of
conscience, it concerns him at least to remain under
the control of reason, which, if it do not compel him
to do right, will restrain him within the limits of expediency,
and thus will insure for him reputation, a
fair position, and a safe course in life, even though it
fail of the highest and most enduring good.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Self-control is easily lost</span></span>, and is often lost unconsciously.
The first surrender of it is prone to be final
and lifelong. Indeed, in many cases, the passion
destined to be dominant has nearly reached the maturity
of its power previously to any outward violation
of the expedient or the right. Where the restraining
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
influences of education and surroundings are
strong, where important interests are at stake, or
where conscience has not been habitually silenced or
tampered with, the perilous appetite, desire, or affection
broods long in the thought, and is so largely
indulged in reverie and anticipation, that it becomes
imperious and despotic before it assumes its wonted
forms of outward manifestation. Hence, the sudden
infatuation and rapid ruin which we sometimes witness,—the
cases in which there seems but a single
step between innocence and deep depravity. In truth
there are many steps; but until they become precipitous,
they are veiled from human sight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Self-control</span></span>, then, in order to be effective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">must
be exercised upon the thoughts and feelings</span></span>, especially
upon the imagination, which fills so largely
with its phantasms and day-dreams our else unoccupied
hours. Let these hours be as few as possible;
and let them be filled with thoughts which we would
not blush to utter, with plans which we could actualize
with the approving suffrage of all good men. The
inward life which would dread expression and exposure,
already puts the outward life in peril; for
passion, thus inwardly nourished and fostered, can
hardly fail to assume sooner or later the control of
the conduct and the shaping of the character. Let
the thoughts be well governed, and the life is emancipated
from passion, and under the control of reason
and principle.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is evident that, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">whatever a man's aims may be,
the attainment of them depends more upon himself
than upon any agency that he can employ</span></span>.
If his aim be extended influence, his words and acts
have simply the force which his character gives them.
If his aim be usefulness, his own personality measures
in part the value of his gifts, and determines entirely
the worth of his services. If his aim be happiness,
the more of a man he is, the larger is his capacity of
enjoyment; for as a dog gets more enjoyment out of
life than a zoöphyte, and a man than a dog, so does
the fully and symmetrically developed man exceed in
receptivity of happiness him whose nature is imperfectly
or abnormally developed. Now it is through
the thorough training and faithful exercise of his
moral faculties and powers that man is most capable
of influence, best fitted for usefulness, and endowed
with the largest capacity for happiness. History
shows this. The men whose lot (if any but our own)
we would be willing to assume, have been, without
an exception, good men. If there are in our respective
circles those whose position we deem in every
respect enviable, they are men of preëminent moral
excellence. We would not take—could we have it—the
most desirable external position with a damaged
character. Probably there are few who do not regard
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a virtuous character as so much to be desired, that in
yielding to temptation and falling under the yoke of
vicious habits they still mean to reform and to become
what they admire. Old men who have led profligate
lives always bear visible tokens of having forfeited all
the valuable purposes of life, often confess that their
whole past has been a mistake, and not infrequently
bear faithful testimony to the transcendent worth of
moral goodness. To remain satisfied without this is,
therefore, a sin against one's own nature, a sacrifice
of well-being and happiness which no one has a right
to make, and which no prudent man will make.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Self-culture in virtue implies and demands reflection
on duty and on the motives to duty, on one's
own nature, capacities and liabilities, and on those
great themes of thought, which by their amplitude
and loftiness enlarge and exalt the minds that become
familiar with them. The mere tongue-work or hand-*work,
of virtue slackens and becomes deteriorated,
when not sustained by profound thought and feeling.
Moreover, it is the mind that acts, and it puts into
its action all that it has—and no more—of moral
and spiritual energy, so that the same outward act
means more or less, is of greater or less worth, in
proportion to the depth and vigor of feeling and
purpose from which it proceeds. It is thus that
religious devotion nourishes virtue, and that none are
so well fitted for the duties of the earthly life as those
who, in their habitual meditation, are the most intimately
conversant with the heavenly life.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In moral self-culture great benefit is derived from
example, whether of the living or the dead. Perhaps
the dead are, in this respect, more useful than
the living. In witnessing the worthy deeds and
beneficent agency of a person of superior excellence,
the tendency is to an over-exact imitation of specific
acts and methods, which, precisely because they are
spontaneous and fitting in his case, will not be so in
the case of his copyist; while the biography of an
eminently good man enlists our sympathy with his
spirit rather than with the details of his life, and
stimulates us to embody the same spirit in widely
different forms of duty and usefulness. Thus the
school-master who in Dr. Arnold's lifetime heard of
his unprecedented success as an educator, would have
been tempted to go to Rugby, to study the system on
the ground, and then to adopt, so far as possible, the
very plans which he there saw in successful operation,—plans
which might have been fitted neither to
his genius, the traditions of his school, nor the demands
of its patrons. At the same time, the interior of
Rugby School was very little known, the principles
of its administration still less, to persons other than
teachers. But Arnold's biography, revealing the
foundation-principles of his character and his work,
raised up for him a host of imitators of all classes
and conditions. Price, who converted his immense
candle-factory near London into a veritable Christian
seminary for mutual improvement in knowledge, virtue,
and piety, professed to owe his impulse to this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enterprise solely to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Life of Arnold,”</span> and like
instances were multiplied in very various professions
throughout the English-speaking world. In fine, example
is of service to us, not in pointing out the
precise things to be done, but in exhibiting the
beauty, loveliness, and majesty of moral goodness,
the possibility of exalted moral attainments, and the
varied scope for their exercise in human life. Even
he whose example we, as Christians, hold in a reverence
which none other shares, is to be imitated, not
by slavishly copying his specific acts, which, because
they were suitable in Judæa in the first century, are
for the most part unfitting in America in the nineteenth
century, but by imbibing his spirit, and then
incarnating it in the forms of active duty and service
appropriate to our time and land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, and obviously, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the practice of virtue</span></span> is
the most efficient means of moral self-culture. As
the thought uttered or written becomes indelibly fixed
in the mind, so does the principle or sentiment embodied
in action become more intimately and persistently
an element of the moral self-consciousness.

those traits of spiritual beauty and excellence which,
in man, call forth our reverence, admiration, and affection,
without loving in Him perfect goodness, purity,
and mercy. These attributes might, indeed, of themselves
fail to present the Supreme Being to our conceptions
as a cognizable personality, were it not that
the personal element is so clearly manifest in the
visible universe and in God's constant providence.
But there are numerous objects, phenomena, and
events in nature and providence which have—so to
speak—a distinctive personal expression, so that the
familiar metaphors of God's countenance, smile, hand,
and voice do not transcend the literal experience of
him who goes through life with the inward eye and
ear always open.

The omnipresence of God makes it the dictate of
natural piety to address Him directly in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">thanksgiving
and prayer</span></span>,—not, of necessity, in words, except
as words are essential to the definiteness of thoughts,
but in such words or thoughts as constitute an expression
to Him of the sentiments of which He is
fittingly the object. As regards prayer, indeed, the
grave doubts that exist in some minds as to its efficacy
might be urged as a reason why it should not
be offered; but wrongly. It is so natural, so intrinsically
fitting to ask what we desire and need of an
omnipresent, omnipotent, all-merciful Being, who has
taught us to call him our Father, that the very appropriateness
of the asking is in itself a strong reason for
believing that we shall not ask in vain. Nor can we
ask in vain, if through this communion of the human
spirit with the Divine there be an inflow of strength
or of peace into the soul that prays, even though the
specific objects prayed for be not granted. That
these objects, when material, are often not granted,
we very well know; yet we know too little of the
extent of material laws, and of the degree to which a
discretionary Providence may work, not in contravention
of, but through those laws, to pronounce dogmatically
that the prayers of men are wholly unrecognized
in the course of events.

As the members of the same community have very
numerous blessings and needs in common, it is obviously
fitting that they should unite in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">public worship,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the community collectively, participation in it must,
by parity of reason, be the duty of its individual
members. Public worship involves the fitness, we
may even say the necessity, of appropriating exclusively
to it certain places and times. Associations
attach themselves to places so indelibly, that it would
be impossible to maintain the gravity and sacredness
of devotional services in buildings or on spots ordinarily
devoted to secular purposes, either of business
or of recreation. Nor could assemblies for worship
be convened, otherwise that at predetermined and
stated intervals; nor could their devotional purpose
be served, were there not stated portions of time
sequestered from ordinary avocations and amusements.
Hence the duty—on the part of all who admit the
fitness of public worship—of reverence for conventionally
sacred places, and of abstinence from whatever
is inconsistent with the religious uses of the day
appropriated to worship.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>

It remains for us to consider <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the obligations imposed
by an acknowledged revelation from God</span></span>.
The position in which we are placed by such a revelation
may best be illustrated by reference to what
takes place in every human family. A judicious
father's commands, precepts, or counsels to his son are
of two kinds. In the first place, he lays emphatic
stress on duties which the son knows or might know
from his own sense of the fitting and the right, such
as honesty, veracity, temperance. These duties will
not be in reality any more incumbent on the son because
they are urged upon him by his father; but
if he be a son worthy of the name, he will be more
profoundly impressed by their obligation, and will
find in his filial love an additional and strong motive
toward their observance. The father will, in the
second place, prescribe either for his son's benefit or
in his own service certain specific acts, in themselves
morally indifferent, and these, when thus prescribed,
are no longer indifferent, but, as acts of obedience to
rightful authority, they become fitting, right, obligatory,
and endowed with all the characteristics of acts
that are in themselves virtuous. Now a revelation
naturally would, and the Christian revelation does,
contain precepts and commands of both these classes.
It prescribes with solemn emphasis the natural virtues
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which are obligatory upon us on grounds of intrinsic
fitness; and though these are not thus made
any the more our duty, we have, through the teachings
and example of Jesus Christ, a more vivid
sense of our obligation, a higher appreciation of the
beauty of virtue, and added motives to its cultivation
derived from the love, the justice, and the retributive
providence of God. The Christian revelation, also,
contains certain directions, not in themselves of any
intrinsic obligation, as, for instance, those relating to
baptism and the eucharist. So far as we can see,
other and very different rites might have served the
same purpose with these. Yet it is fitting and right
that these, and not others, should be observed, simply
because the Divine authority which enacts them has
a right to command and to be obeyed. Duties of
this class are commonly called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">positive</span></span>, in contradistinction
from natural obligations. Both classes
are equally imperative on the ground of fitness; but
with this difference, that in the latter class the fitness
resides in the duties themselves, in the former it
grows out of the relation between him who gives and
those who receive the command.

very brief period of dependence; while the human
child advances very slowly toward maturity, and for
a considerable portion of his life needs, for both body

seniors. The separation of parents by other causes

which of them the custody of their children appertained;
and in whichever way they were disposed of,
their due nurture and education would be inadequately
secured. The children might be thrown
upon the mother's care, while the means of supporting
them belonged exclusively to the father. Or in
the father's house they might suffer for lack of a
mother's personal attention and services; while if he
contracted a new matrimonial connection, the children
of the previous marriage could hardly fail of
neglect, or even of hatred and injury, from their
mother's successful rival, especially if she had children

of temper and character makes married
life a burden and a weariness to both parties. But
the cases are much more numerous, in which discrepancies
of taste and disposition are brought by time
and habit into a more comprehensive harmony, and
the husband and wife, because unlike, become only
the more essential, each to the other's happiness and
welfare. Where there is sincere affection, there is
little danger that lapse of years in a permanent marriage
will enfeeble it; while, were the contract voidable
at will, there might be after marriage, as often
before marriage, a series of attachments of seemingly
equal ardor, each to be superseded in its turn by
some new attraction. Where, on the other hand, the
union is the result, not of love, but of mutual esteem
and confidence, aided by motives of convenience, the
very possibility of an easy divorce would render each
party captious and suspicious, so that confidence
could be easily shaken, and esteem easily impaired;
while in those who expect always to have a common
home the tendency is to those habits of mutual tolerance,
accommodation, and concession, through which
confidence and esteem ripen into sincere and lasting
affection.

of these duties are obviously contingent on the parent's
ability; others are absolute and imperative.
The judicious parent will, on the one hand, retain his
parental authority as long as he is legally responsible

condition of things man is defended by his own nature.
It is more natural to tell the truth than to
utter falsehood. The very persons who are the least

may be true, the circumstances or the manner of
utterance may be such as inevitably to impose the

may be told in such a way as to convey an altogether
false impression. A fact may be stated with the express
purpose of misleading the hearer with regard to
another fact. Looks or gestures may be framed with
the intent to communicate or confirm a falsehood.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">But has not one a right to conceal facts which
another has no right to know?</span></span> In such a case,
concealment is undoubtedly a right; but falsehood,
or equivocation, or truth which will convey a false
impression, is not a right. This question has not unfrequently
arisen with regard to anonymous publications.
It might be a fair subject of inquiry, whether
anonymous writing is not in all cases objectionable,
on the ground that a sense of personal responsibility
for statements given to the public would insure a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more uniform regard to truth and justice, as well as
greater care in the ascertainment of facts, and more
mature deliberation in the formation of judgments
and opinions. But if anonymous writing be justified,
the writer is authorized to guard his secret by employing
a copyist, or by covert modes of transmission
to the press, or by avoiding such peculiarities of style
as might betray him. But if, notwithstanding these
precautions, the authorship be suspected and charged
upon him, we cannot admit his right to denial,
whether expressly, or by implication, or even by the
utterance of a misleading fact. He undertook the
authorship with the risk of discovery; he had no
right to give publicity to what he has need to be
ashamed of; and if there be secondary, though grave
reasons why he would prefer to remain unknown,
they cannot be sufficient to justify him in falsehood.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Is truth to be told to an insane person</span></span>, when it
might be dangerous to him or to others? May not
he be deceived for his benefit, decoyed into a place of
safe detention, or deterred by falsehood from some
intended act of violence? Those who have the
guardianship of the insane are unanimous in the
opinion that falsehood, when discovered by them,
is always attended with injurious consequences, and
that it should be resorted to only when imperatively
required for their immediate safety or for that of
others. But in such cases the severest moralist could
not deny the necessity, and therefore the right, of
falsehood. But it would be falsehood in form, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not in fact. Truth-telling implies two conscious parties.
The statement from which an insane person will
draw false inferences, and which will drive him to
an act or paroxysm of madness, is not truth to him.
The statement which is indispensable to his safety,
repose, or reasonable conduct, is virtually true to him,
inasmuch as it conveys impressions as nearly conformed
to the truth as he is capable of receiving.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Is falsehood justifiable for the safety of one's
own life or that of others?</span></span> This is a broad question,
and comprehends a very wide diversity of cases.
It includes the cases, in which the alternative is to
deny one's political or religious convictions, or to suffer
death for the profession of them. Here, however,
there can be no difference of opinion. Political freedom
and religious truth have been, in past ages,
propagated more effectively by martyrdoms, than by
any other instrumentality; and no men have so fully
merited the gratitude and reverence of their race as
those who have held the truth dearer than life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the form which the question ordinarily assumes
is this: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">If by false information I can prevent
the commission of an atrocious crime, am I justified
in the falsehood?</span></span> It ought first to be said,
that this is hardly a practical question. Probably it
has never presented itself practically to any person
under whose eye these pages will fall, or in any instance
within his knowledge. Nor can the familiar
discussion of such extreme cases be of any possible
benefit. On the other hand, he who familiarizes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
himself with the idea that under such a stress of circumstances
what else were wrong becomes right, will
be prone to apply similar reasoning to an exigency
somewhat less urgent, and thence to any case in
which great apparent good might result from a departure
from strict veracity. Far better is it to make
literal truth the unvarying law of life, and then to
rest in the assurance that, should an extreme case
present itself, the exigency of the moment will suggest
the course to be pursued. Yet, in ethical strictness,
falsehood from one self-conscious person to another
cannot be justified; but we can conceive of circumstances
in which it might be extenuated. There
are no degrees of right; but of wrong there may be
an infinite number of degrees. One straight line cannot
be straighter than another; but we can conceive
of a curve or a waving line that shall have but an
infinitesimal divergence from a straight line. So in
morals, there may be an infinitesimal wrong,—an act
which cannot be pronounced right, yet shall diverge
so little from the right that conscience would contract
from it no appreciable stain, that man could not condemn
it, and that we cannot conceive of its being
registered against the soul in the chancery of heaven.
Such may be the judgment which would properly
attach itself to a falsehood by which an atrocious
crime was prevented.

making the truthful declaration of a sincere purpose,
and in their execution an equal loyalty to the truth,
even though it involve inconvenience, cost, or loss.
The words of a promise may often bear more than
one interpretation; but it is obviously required by
veracity that the promiser should fulfil his promise in
the sense in which he supposed it to be understood by
him to whom it was made.

There are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">cases in which a promise should not

void from the beginning. It is wrong to make it, and
a double wrong to keep it. The promise to perform
an act, not intrinsically immoral, but unlawful, should
be regarded in the same light. If both parties were
aware, when the promise was made, of the unlawfulness
of the act, then neither party has the right to
deem himself injured by the other. If, however, the
promiser was aware of the unlawfulness of his promise,
while the promisee supposed it lawful, the promiser,
though not bound by his promise, is under
obligation to remunerate the promisee for his disappointment
or loss. If the act promised becomes unlawful
between the making and the execution of the
promise, the promise is made void, and the promisee
has no ground of complaint against the promiser.
Thus, if a man promised to send to a correspondent
goods of a certain description at a certain time, and
before that time the exportation of such goods were
prohibited by law, he would be free both from his
promise and from responsibility for its non-fulfilment.

A promise neither immoral nor unlawful, but made
under a mistake common to both parties, and such
as—had it been known—would have prevented the
promise, is void. An extorted promise to perform
an immoral or unlawful act cannot be binding. One
has, indeed, no moral right to make such a promise,
though if the case be one of extreme urgency and
peril, extenuating circumstances may reduce the
wrong to an infinitesimal deviation from the right;
but, when the duress is over, no considerations can
justify the performance of what it was wrong to
promise. But a promise, not in itself immoral or
unlawful, is binding, though made under duress.
Thus, if a man attacked by bandits has had his life
spared on condition of a pecuniary ransom, he is
bound to pay the ransom; for at the moment of peril
he thought his life worth all he promised to give for
it, and it is neither immoral nor unlawful to give
money, even to a robber. In a case like this, regard
for the safety of others should, also, have weight; for
in a country liable to such perils, the breach of a
promise by one man might cost the community the
lives of many.

exacted of witnesses in courts of justice in confirmation
of their testimony, and of incumbents of public
offices in pledge of their fidelity. They are required,
too, in attestation of invoices, inventories of estates,
returns of taxable property, and various financial and
statistical statements made under public authority.
There are, also, not a few persons of whom, and occasions

tell the truth, or to fulfil his promise. This obligation
is entire and perfect in all cases, on the ground
of intrinsic fitness, and of the known will and command
of God. But the tendency of oaths is to establish
in the minds of men two classes of assertions and
promises, one more sacred than the other. He who
is required under the solemn sanction of an oath
merely to tell the truth or to make a promise in good
faith, arrives naturally at the conclusion that he is
bound to a less rigid accuracy or fidelity in ordinary
statements or promises. The law of the land, as we
have seen, bears an important part in the ethical education
of the young; and by means of the legal distinction
created between assertions or promises under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
oath and those made without that sanction, children
and youth are trained to regard simple truth-telling
and promise-keeping as of secondary obligation.
This effect of legal oaths is attested by the prevalence
of profane swearing, and by the frequent use of oath-like
forms of asseveration, not regarded as profane, by
persons of a more serious character. Except in the
religious sects that abjure the use of oaths, nine persons
out of ten swear more or less, and spontaneously
confirm statements which are in the least degree
strange or difficult of belief, or promises to which
they wish to give an air of sincerity and earnestness,
by the strongest oaths they dare to use. This comes
of a felt necessity, which will exist as long as preëminent
sanctity is attached to legal oaths.

the attention of those concerned is directed with the
less careful scrutiny to the character for veracity borne
by him to whom it is administered. In point of fact,
men swear falsely whenever and wherever they would
be willing to utter falsehood without an oath. In
courts of justice, the pains and penalties of perjury
undoubtedly prevent a great deal of false swearing;
but precisely the same penalties are attached to the
affirmation of persons who, on the ground of religious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scruples, are excused from swearing, and they
certainly are none too severe for false testimony, in
whatever way it may be given. Notwithstanding
this check, however, it is well known that before a
corrupt or incompetent tribunal, an unprincipled
advocate never finds any difficulty in buying false
testimony; and even where justice is uprightly and
skilfully administered, it is not rare to encounter
between equally credible witnesses such flagrant and
irreconcilable contradictions as to leave no room for
any hypothesis other than perjury on one side or
both. Perjury in transactions with the national
revenue and with municipal assessors is by no means
unprecedented among persons of high general reputation.
False oaths of this description are, indeed, not
infrequently preceded by some fictitious formalism,
such as an unreal and temporary transfer of property;
but this is done, not in order to evade the guilt
of perjury, but, in case of detection, to open a technical
escape from its legal penalty. Promissory oaths
are of equally little worth. There is not a public
functionary from the President of the United States
to the village constable, who does not take what is
meant to be a solemn oath (though often administered
with indecent levity) to be loyal to the constitution
of the country or state, and faithful in the
discharge of his official duties. Yet what effect has
this vast amount of swearing, if it be not to make
perjury so familiar an offence as to be no longer
deemed disgraceful? Not a bribe is taken by a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
member of Congress, not a contract surreptitiously
obtained by a municipal official, not an appointment
made to the known detriment of the public on personal
or party grounds, without the commission of a
crime, in theory transcendentally heinous, in practice
constantly condoned and ignored. Nor can we be
mistaken in regarding the sacrilege and virtual blasphemy
resulting from the institution of judicial, assertory,
and promissory oaths, as holding no secondary
place among the causes of the moral decline
and corruption of which we witness so manifest tokens.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To one who does not carry foregone conclusions of
his own to the interpretation of the New Testament,
it can hardly appear otherwise than certain that the
Founder of Christianity intended to prohibit all
oaths. His precept, <span class="tei tei-q">“Swear not at all,”</span> occurs in a
series of specifications of maxims drawn from the
standard morality of his day, under each of which he
sets aside the existing ethical rule, and substitutes for
it one covering precisely the same ground, and conformed
to the intrinsic right as represented in his
own spirit and life. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have heard that it hath
been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
but I say unto you, that ye resist not evil.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye
have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love
thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy; but I say unto
you, Love your enemies.”</span> The analogy of these and
other declarations of the same series compels us to
believe that when Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have heard that it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord
thine oaths,”</span> the precept which followed, <span class="tei tei-q">“I say unto
you, Swear not at all,”</span> must have applied to the same
subject-matter with the maxim which precedes it,—that
Jesus must have intended to disallow something
that had been previously permitted. If so, not trivial
or profane oaths alone, but oaths made in good
faith and with due solemnity must have been included
in the precept, <span class="tei tei-q">“Swear not at all.”</span><a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
It is historically
certain that the primitive Christians thus
understood the evangelic precept. They not only
refused the usual idolatrous forms of adjuration, but
maintained that all oaths had been forbidden by their
Divine Lawgiver; nor have we any proof of their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having receded from this position, until that strange
fusion of church and state under Constantine, in
which it is hard to say whether Christianity mounted
the throne of the Cæsars or succumbed to their rule.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Notwithstanding the undoubted increase of dishonesty</span></span>
in recent times and its disastrous frequency,
there can be no doubt that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the majority of men are
honest</span></span>, and that the transactions in which there is
no deception or wrong, largely outnumber those
which are fraudulent. Were this not so, there could
be neither confidence nor credit, enterprise would be
paralyzed, business would be reduced to the lowest
demands of absolute necessity, and every man would
be the sole custodian of what he might make, produce,
or in any way acquire. There can, therefore, be no
element more directly hostile to the permanence, not
to say the progress, of material civilization and of the
higher interests which depend upon it, than fraud,
peculation, and the violation of trust, in pecuniary
and mercantile affairs, and with reference to public
funds and measures. Yet there are methods, for
which to a large degree honest men are responsible,
in which dishonesty is created, nourished, and rewarded.
In political life, if few office-holders are
inaccessible to bribes, it is not because men of impregnable
integrity might not, as in earlier times, be
found in ample numbers for all places of trust; but
because the compromises, humiliations, and concessions
through which alone, in many of our constituencies,
one can become the candidate of a party, are
such as an honest man either would spurn at the outset,
or could endure only by parting with his honesty.
So long as men will persist in electing to municipal
trusts those whose sole qualification is blind loyalty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and unscrupulous service to a party, they can expect
only robbery under the form of taxation; and, in
fact, the financial revelations that have been made in
the commercial metropolis of our country are typical
of what is taking place, so far as opportunity serves,
in cities, towns, and villages all over the land. As
regards embezzlements, forgeries, and frauds in the
management of pecuniary trusts, there can be no
doubt that the number is greatly multiplied by the
morbid sympathy of the public with the criminals, by
their frequent evasion of punishment or prompt pardon
after conviction, and by the ease with which they
have often recovered their social position and the
means of maintaining it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to this complicity with fraud and wrong
on the part of the public, there are many ways in
which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">dishonesty engenders</span></span>,
almost necessitates <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">dishonesty</span></span>.
A branch of business, in itself honest, may
be virtually closed against an honest man. The
adulterations of food, so appallingly prevalent, will
suggest an illustration of this point. There are commodities
in which the mixture of cheaper ingredients
cannot be detected by the purchaser, and which in
their debased form can be offered at so low a price as
to drive the genuine commodities which they replace
out of the market; and thus the alternative is presented
to the hitherto honest dealer to participate
in the fraud, or to quit the business. The former
course is, no doubt, taken by many who sincerely
regret the seeming necessity.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Dishonesty</span></span> not only injures the immediate sufferer
by the fraud or wrong, but when it becomes frequent,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">is a public injury</span></span> and calamity. In one way
or another it alienates from the use of every honest
man a very large proportion of his earnings or income.
In this country, at the present time, we probably
fall short of the truth in saying that at least a
third part of every citizen's income is paid in the
form of either direct or indirect taxation, and of this
amount a percentage much larger than would be readily
believed is pillaged on its way into the treasury
or in its disbursement. Then, as regards bad debts
(so-called), most of them fraudulently contracted or
evaded, they are not, in general, the loss of the immediate
creditor, nor ought they to be; he is obliged
to charge for his goods a price which will cover these
debts, and honest purchasers must thus pay the dues
of the insolvent purchaser. Nor is this a solitary instance
in which innocent persons are obliged to suffer
for wrongs with which they seem to have no necessary
connection. There are very few exceptions to
the rule, under which, however, we have room but
one more example. It is a well known fact that
many American railways have not only cost very
much more money than was ever laid out upon them,
but are made, by keeping the construction-account
long and generously open, to represent on the books
of the respective corporations much larger sums than
they cost,—especially in cases where the enterprise
is lucrative and the dividends are limited by statute.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now in some sections of our country a transaction of
this kind—essentially fraudulent, under however
respectable auspices—is a disastrous check on productive
industry by the heavy freight-tariff which it
imposes,—so heavy sometimes as to keep bulky
commodities, as wheat and corn, out of the markets
where, at a fair cost for transportation, they might
find remunerative sale. Thus the very means devised
for opening the resources of a region of country
may be abused to their obstruction and hindrance.
In fine, dishonesty in all its forms has a diffusive
power of injury, and, on the mere ground of self-defence,
demands the remonstrance and antagonism
of the entire community.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While in most departments of conduct there is a
wide neutral <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">ground between the right and the
condemnably wrong</span></span>, there are matters of business
in which there seems to be no such intermediate territory,
but in which what is fair, honorable, and even
necessary, is closely contiguous to dishonesty. Thus,
except in the simplest retail business, all modern commerce
is speculation, and the line between legitimate
and dishonest speculation is to some minds difficult
of discernment. Yet the discrimination may be
made. A man has a right to all that he earns by
services to the community, and these earnings may in
individual instances reach an immense sum. We can
easily understand how this may be, nay, must needs
be the case with the very high salaries paid to master
manufacturers. Such salaries would not be paid, did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not the intelligence, skill, and organizing capacity of
these men cheapen by a still larger amount the commodities
made under their direction. The case is
precisely similar with the merchant engaged in legitimate
commerce. By his knowledge of the right
times and best modes of purchasing, by his enterprise
and sagacity in maintaining intercourse with and
between distant markets, and by his outlay of capital
and skill as a carrier of commodities from the place
of their production to the place where they are
needed for use, he cheapens the goods that pass
through his hands by a greater amount than the toll
he levies upon them, which—however large—is his
rightful due.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus also, when, in anticipation of a scarcity of
some one commodity, a merchant so raises the price
as essentially to diminish the sale, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">he earns his increased
profits</span></span>; for an enhanced price is the only
practicable check on consumption. For instance, if
at the actual rate of consumption the bread-stuff on
hand would be consumed a month before the new
harvest could be made availing, no statistical statement
could prevent the month of famine; but experienced
grain-merchants can adjust the price of the
stock in hand so as to induce precisely the amount of
economy which will make that stock last till it can be
replaced. They will, indeed, obtain a large profit on
their sales, and will be accused by ignorant persons
of speculating on scarcity and popular apprehension;
but it will be due wholly to their prescience that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scarcity did not become famine, and the apprehension
suffering; and they will have merited for this service
more than the largest profits that can accrue to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same principles will apply to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">speculation in
stocks</span></span>, which is in many minds identified with dishonest
gain. Stocks are marketable commodities,
equally with sugar and salt. They are liable to
legitimate fluctuations in value, their actual value
being affected, often by facts that transpire, often by
opinions that rest on assignable grounds. Now if a
man possess skill and foresight enough to buy stocks
at their lowest rates and to sell them when they will
bring him a profit, he makes a perfectly legitimate
investment of his intelligence and sagacity, and in
facilitating sales for those who need to sell, and purchases
for those who wish to buy, and thus preventing
capital from lying unused, or remaining inconvertible
at need, he earns all that his business yields
him by the substantial services which he renders.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The legitimate business of the merchant and the
broker is contingent, as we have seen, on fluctuations
in the market</span></span>, and he who has the sagacity to
foresee these fluctuations and the enterprise to prepare
for them, derives from them advantage to which
he is fairly entitled. But it is precisely at this point
that the stress of temptation rests, and the opportunity
presents itself for dishonesty in ways of which
the laws take no cognizance, and on which public
opinion is by no means severe. The contingencies
which sagacity can foresee, capital and credit can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
often create. Virtual scarcity may be produced by
forestalling and monopoly. When there is no actual
dearth, even famine-prices may be obtained for the
necessaries of life by the skilful manipulation of the
grain-market. So too, in the stock-market, bonds
and shares, instead of being bought or sold for what
they are worth, of actual owners and to real purchasers,
may be merely gambled with,—bought in
large amounts in order to create a demand that
shall swell their price, or so thrown upon the market
as to reduce their price below their real value,
and all this with the sole purpose of mutual contravention
and discomfiture. By operations of this
kind, not only is no useful end subserved, but the
financial interests and relations of the community are
injuriously, often ruinously, deranged; while not a
few private holders of stock have their credit essentially
impaired by a sudden fall of price, or by the
inflation of nominal value are led into rash speculations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the cases cited it may be seen how closely <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the
right abuts upon the wrong</span></span>, so that one may over-pass
the line almost unconsciously. Yet it is believed
that a man may determine for himself on which
side of the line he belongs. The department of business,
or the mode of transacting business, which cannot
by any possibility be of benefit to the community,
still more, that which in its general course is of positively
injurious tendency, is essentially dishonest,
even though there be no individual acts of fraud. He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
really defrauds the public who lives upon the public
without rendering, or purposing to render any valuable
return; and if there be any profession or department
of business to which this description applies, it should
be avoided or forsaken by every man who means to be
honest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the many mooted cases in which the question
of honesty is involved, our proposed limits will
permit us to consider only that of usury<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> (so-called).
There can be no doubt that usury laws and the opinion
that sustains them sprang from the false theory,
according to which money was regarded, not as value,
but merely as the measure of value. It is now understood
that it owes its capacity to measure value solely
to its own intrinsic value; that its paper representatives
can equal it in purchasing power only when
convertible at pleasure into coin; and that paper not
immediately convertible can obtain the character of
money only so far as there is promise or hope of its
ultimate conversion into coin. It follows that money
stands on the same footing with all other values,—that
its use, therefore, is a marketable commodity,
varying indefinitely in its fitting price, according as
money is abundant or scarce, the loan for a long or a
short period, and the borrower of more or less certain
solvency. For ordinary loans the relations of supply
and demand are amply competent to regulate the rate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of interest, while he who incurs an extra-hazardous
risk fairly earns a correspondingly high rate of compensation.
There is, therefore, no intrinsic wrong in
one's obtaining for the use of his money all that it is
worth; and while we cannot justify the violation of
any laws not absolutely immoral, dishonesty forms no
part of the offence of the man who takes more than
legal interest.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>

What we should dread others feel. The things which
we find or deem essential to our well-being, many
lack. We, it may be, possess them or the means of
procuring them, beyond our power of personal use.
This larger share of material goods has come to us,
indeed, honestly, by the operation of laws inherent
in the structure of society, and thus, as we believe, by
Divine appointment. At the same time we are conscious,
in a greater or less degree, of the benevolent
affections. We are moved to pity by the sight or
knowledge of want or suffering. Our sense of fitness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is painfully disturbed by the existence of needs
unsupplied, of calamities unrelieved. We cannot but
be aware of the adaptation of such superfluity of material
goods as we may possess to beneficent uses; and
it can hardly be that we shall not rest in the belief
that, in the inevitable order of society, it is the predetermined
design and purpose of abundance to supply
deficiency,—of the capacity of service, to meet the
ever pressing demands for service. Beneficence, then,
is a duty based on considerations of intrinsic fitness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">beneficence must be actual</span></span>, not merely formal,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">good-doing</span></span>. Some of the most easy and obvious
modes of supply or relief are adapted to perpetuate
the very evils to which they minister, either
by destroying self-respect, by discouraging self-help,
or by granting immunity to positively vicious habits.
The tendency of instinctive kindness is to indiscriminate
giving. But there can be very few cases in
which this is not harmful. It sustains mendicants as
a recognized class of society; and as such they are
worse than useless. They necessarily lose all sense of
personal dignity; they remain ignorant or become incapable
of all modes of regular industry, and it is impossible
for them to form associations that will be
otherwise than degrading and corrupting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of equally injurious tendency are the various
modes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">relief at the public charge</span></span>. They affix
upon their beneficiaries the indelible brand of pauperism,
which in numerous instances becomes hereditary,
and in not a few cases has been transmitted through
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
several generations. Experience has shown that recovery
from a condition thus dependent is exceedingly
rare, even with the young and strong, who, had
they been tided over the stress of need by private and
judicious charity, would shortly have resumed their
place among the self-subsisting members of the community.
Public alms, while they are thus harmful
to their recipients, impose upon society a far heavier
burden than private charity. This is due in part to
the permanent pauperism created by the system, in
part to the wastefulness which characterizes public
expenditures of every kind. By special permission of
the national legislature, the experiment was tried in
Glasgow, under the direction of Dr. Chalmers, of substituting
private munificence for relief from the public
chest, in one of the poorest territorial parishes of the
city, embracing a population of ten thousand, and the
result was the expenditure of little more than one
third of what had been expended under legal authority.
At the same time, the poor and suffering were
so much more faithfully and kindly cared for, that
there was a constant overflow of poverty from the
other districts of the city into this. Public charity,
when thoroughly systematized, is liable to the still
stronger objection, that those who are able to give
relief, in ceasing to feel the necessity, lose the will
and the capacity of benevolent effort. Yet, were
there no public provision for the poor, there would be
cases of destitution, disease, disability, and mental
imbecility, which would elude private charity, however
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
diligent and generous. It must be remembered,
too, that the same causes may at once enhance the
demand for beneficent aid, and cripple its resources.
Thus, in a conflagration, a flood, a dearth, or a commercial
panic, while the stress of need among the
poor is greatly intensified, the persons on whose charity,
under ordinary circumstances, they could place
the most confident reliance, may be among the chief
sufferers. Thus, also, during the prevalence of infectious
disease, a large proportion of those who are wont
to perform the offices of humanity for the suffering, are
withdrawn by their own fears, or those of their friends,
from their wonted field of service. Then, too, there
are various forms of disease and infirmity, which demand
special treatment or a permanent asylum; and
while institutions designed to meet these wants are
more wisely and economically administered under private
than under public auspices, the state should never
suffer them to fail or languish for lack of subsidy
from private sources. The most desirable condition
of things undoubtedly is that—more nearly realized
in France than in any other country in Christendom—in
which the relief of the poor and suffering
in ordinary cases, and the charge of charitable institutions
to a large degree, are left to individuals, voluntary
organizations, and religious fraternities and
sisterhoods, while government supplements and subsidizes
private charity where it is found inadequate to
the need.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The demands upon beneficence are by no means
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exhausted, when material relief and aid have been bestowed.
Indeed, alms are often given as a purchase
of quitclaim for personal service. But the manifestation
and expression of sympathy may make the gift
of immeasurably more worth and efficacy. Considerate
courtesy, delicacy, and gentleness are essential
parts of beneficence. There are very few so abject
that they do not feel insulted and degraded by what
is coldly, grudgingly, superciliously, or chidingly bestowed;
while the thoughtful tenderness which never
forgets the sensibilities of those whom it relieves, inspires
comfort, hope, and courage, arouses whatever
capacity there may be of self-help, and is often the
means of replacing the unfortunate in the position
from which they have fallen.

of a magnitude that eludes all computation.
There is hardly a transaction, an interview, a casual
wayside meeting, in which it is not in the power of
each person concerned to contribute in an appreciable
degree to the happiness or the discomfort of those
whom he thus meets, or with whom he is brought into
a relation however transient. In all our movements
among our fellow-men, it is possible for us to <span class="tei tei-q">“go about
doing good.”</span> What we can thus do we are bound to do.
We perceive and feel that this is fitting for us as social
and as mutually dependent beings. We are conscious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the benefit accruing to us from little, nameless
attentions and courtesies, often of mere look, or
manner, or voice; and from these experiences we infer
that the possibility, and therefore the duty of beneficence
is coextensive with our whole social life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">measure of beneficence</span></span>, prescribed for us on
the most sacred authority, <span class="tei tei-q">“All things whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them,”</span> needs only to be stated to be received as
authentic. It supplies a measure for our expectations
also, as well as for our duties. We have a right to
expect from others as much courtesy, kindness, service
as, were they in our place and we in theirs, we
should feel bound to render to them,—a rule which
would often largely curtail our expectations, and in
the same proportion tone down our disappointments
and imagined grievances.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another scriptural precept, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself,</span></span>”</span> which might at first
sight seem impracticable, yet which, as we shall see
on closer examination, represents not only a possible
attainment, but one toward which all who heartily
desire and love to do good are tending. There are
various conditions under which, confessedly, human
beings love others as well as themselves, or better.
What else can we say of the mother's love for her
child, for whose well-being she would make any conceivable
sacrifice, nay, were there need, would surrender
life itself? Have we not also sometimes witnessed,
a filial devotion equally entire and self-forgetting?
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor are instances wanting, in which brothers and sisters,
or friends who had no bonds of consanguinity,
have shown by unmistakable deeds and sufferings that
their love for one another was at least equal to their
self-love. This same love for others, as for himself,
is manifested by the self-devoting patriot, the practical
philanthropist, the Christian missionary. There
is ample ground for it in the theory of humanity
which forms a part of our accustomed religious utterance.
We call our fellow-men our brethren, as children
of the same Father. So far as sayings like these
are sentiments, and not mere words, there must be
in our feelings and conduct toward and for our fellow-men
in general a kindness, forbearance, self-forgetfulness,
and self-sacrifice similar to that of which,
toward our near kindred, we would not confess ourselves
incapable. Here it must be borne in mind that
the precepts of Christianity represent the perfection
which should be our constant aim and our only goal,
not the stage of attainment which we are conscious
of having reached, or of being able to reach with
little effort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The love of enemies</span></span> is also enjoined upon us by
Jesus Christ. Is this possible? Why not? There
are cases where one's nearest kindred are his worst
enemies; and we have known instances in which love
has survived this rudest of all trials. Were the Christian
idea of universal brotherhood a profound sentiment,
it would not be quenched by enmity, however
bitter. Enmity toward ourselves need not affect our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
estimate of one's actual merit or claims. If we should
not think the worse of a man because he was the
enemy of some one else, why should we think the
worse of him because he is our enemy? He may have
mistaken our character and our dispositions; and if
so, is he more culpable for this than for any other mistake?
Or if, on the other hand, he has some substantial
reason for disliking us, we should either remove
the cause, or submit to the dislike without feeling aggrieved
by it. At any rate we can obey the precept,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do good to them that hate you;”</span> and this is the
only way, and an almost infallible way, in which the
enmity may be overcome, and superseded by relations
of mutual kindness and friendship.

There are, in almost every prolonged human experience,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">privations and sufferings to be endured,
disappointments to be submitted to, obstacles and
difficulties to be surmounted and overcome</span></span>. From
whatever source these elements of experience proceed,
even if from blind chance, or from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fate</span></span> (which denotes
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">utterance</span></span> or decree of arbitrary and irresponsible
power), the strong man will brace himself up to
bear them; the wise man will shape his conduct by
them; the man of lofty soul will rise above them.
But the temper in which they will be borne, yielded
to, or surmounted, must be contingent on the belief
concerning them. If they are regarded as actual evils,
they will probably be endured with sullenness, or
submitted to with defiance and scorn, or surmounted
with pride and self-inflation. Even in the writings of
the later Stoics, which abound in edifying precepts of
fortitude and courage under trial, there is an undertone
of defiance, as if the sufferer were contending
with a hostile force, and a constant tendency to extol
and almost deify the energy of soul which the good
man displays in fighting with a hard destiny. If, on
the other hand, physical evils are regarded as wise and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
benign appointments of the Divine love and fatherhood,
the spirit in which they are borne and struggled
against is characterized by tenderness, meekness, humility,
trust, and hope. It is instructive in this regard
to read alternately the Stoics and St. Paul, and
to contrast their magnanimous, but grim and stern
resignation, with the jubilant tone in which, a hundred
times over, and with a vast variety of gladsome utterance,
he repeats the sentiment contained in those
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.”</span> As
ours is the Christian theory as to the (so-called) evils
of human life, we shall recognize it in our treatment
of the several virtues comprehended under the general
title of Fortitude.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Patience</span></span> is incumbent on us, only under inevitable
sufferings or hardships, or under such as are incurred
in the discharge of manifest duty, or for the
benefit of our fellow-men. Needless sufferings or privations
we are bound to shun or to escape, not to
bear. The caution and foresight by which they may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be evaded hold an essential place among the duties of
prudence. Nor does reason or religion sanction self-imposed
burdens or hardships of any kind, whether
in penance for wrong-doing, as a means of purchasing
the Divine favor, or as a mode of spiritual discipline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Patience implies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">serenity, cheerfulness, and hopefulness</span></span>,
under burdens and trials. It must be distinguished
from apathy, which is a temperament, not a
virtue. There are some persons whose sensibilities
are so sluggish that they are incapable of keen suffering,
and of profound and lasting sorrow. We can
hardly call this a desirable temperament; for its capacity
of enjoyment is equally defective, and, as there
is more happiness than misery in almost every life, he
whose susceptibility of both pain and pleasure is quick
and strong is, on the whole, the gainer thereby. The
serenity of patience requires vigorous self-command.
It is essential, first of all, to control, and as far as
possible to suppress, the outward tokens of pain and
grief. They, like all modes of utterance, deepen the
feeling they express; while a firm and self-contained
bearing enhances the fortitude which it indicates.
Control must also be exercised over the thoughts, that
they be abstracted from the painful experience, and
employed on themes that will fill and task them.
Mental industry is the best relief that mere philosophy
has for pain and sorrow; and though it certainly
is not a cure, it never fails to be of service as
a palliative. Even when bodily distress or infirmity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
renders continuous thought impossible, the effort of
recollection, or the employment of the mind in matters
too trivial for its exercise in health, may relieve
the weariness and lighten the stress of suffering. Nor
let devices of this sort be deemed unworthy of a place
even among duties; for they are often essential means
to ends of high importance. They assert and maintain
the rightful supremacy of the mind over the
body; they supersede that morbid brooding upon
painful experiences which generates either melancholy
or querulousness; and they leave in the moral nature
an unobstructed entrance to all soothing and elevating
influences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Cheerfulness</span></span> in the endurance of pain and hardship
must result in great part from the belief. If I regard
myself as irresistibly subject to an automatic Nature,
whose wheels may bruise or crush me at any moment,
I know not why or how I could be cheerful, even in
such precarious health or prosperity as might fall to
my lot; and there could certainly be no reassuring
aspect to my adverse fortune. But if I believe that
under a fatherly Providence there can be no suffering
without its ministry of mercy, no loss without its
greater gain within my reach and endeavor, no hardship
without its reflex benefit in inward growth and
energy, then I can take and bear the inevitable burdens
of this earthly life in the same spirit in which I
often assume burdens not imposed upon me from
without, for the more than preponderant benefit which
I hope to derive from them. But if I have this faith
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in a benignant Providence which will not afflict me
uselessly, I am under obligation not to let my faith,
if real, remain inactive in my seasons of pain, loss, or
grief. I am bound so to ponder on my assured belief,
and on such proofs of it as may lie in my past
experience, that it shall give its hue to my condition,
its tone to my thought, its direction to the whole
current of my sentiment and feeling. Thus may endurance
be not only calm, but cheerful, because pervaded
by the conviction that at the heart of all that
seems evil there is substantial good.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, it cannot be denied that there are life-long
burdens and griefs,—incurable illnesses, irretrievable
losses, bereavements that will never cease to be felt,
and cannot be replaced. Especially in advanced
years there are infirmities, disabilities, and privations,
which cannot by any possibility have a resultant revenue
equivalent to what they take from us; for in old
age the growth of character is too slow to be worth
the sacrifice which in earlier life may be more than
compensated by the consciousness of spiritual enlargement
and increase. How shall these burdens be
borne cheerfully? They cannot, unless they be also
borne hopefully. But if there be presented to the
faith, beyond the earthly life, a future, the passage
into which is to be made the easier by loss and sorrow
here; if families are there to be reunited, and void
places in the affections filled again; if worthy hopes,
seemingly disappointed, are only postponed for a
richer and happier fulfilment,—there is in that future
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exhaustless strength for solace and support under
what must be endured here. Earthly trial must seem
light and momentary in view of perfect and eternal
happiness; and thus the hope that lays hold on an
infinite domain of being is coined into utilities for the
daily needs of the tried, suffering, afflicted, and age-bowed,
supplying to patience an element without
which it cannot be made perfect.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are events, seemingly adverse, which in
themselves are transient, and inflict no permanent discomfort,
but which necessitate the surrender of cherished
expectations, the change of favorite plans, it
may be, the life-long abandonment of aims and hopes
that had held the foremost place in the anticipated
future. Here submission of some sort is a necessity.
But the submission may be querulous and repining;
it may be bitter and resentful; it may be stern and
rigid. In the last of these types only can there be
any semblance of virtue; and this last can be virtuous,
only where inevitable events are attributed to
Fate, and not to Providence. But if a wise and kind
Providence presides over human affairs, its decrees
are our directory. The very events which hedge in,
mark out our way. The tree which has its upward
growth checked spreads its branches; that which is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
circumscribed in its lateral expansion attains the
greater height. The tendrils of the vine are guided
by the very obstacles placed in its way. Thus, in
human life, impassable barriers in one direction prescribe
aims and endeavors in a different direction.
The things that we cannot do determine the things
that we ought to do. The growth which is impeded
must give place to growth of a different type, and to
us undoubtedly more wholesome, more congenial with
our capacities, more conducive to our true well-being.
What seem obstacles may be supports, giving the
best possible direction to our active powers, and so
training our desires and affections as to lead to higher
happiness and more substantial good than could have
otherwise been attained.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Submission</span></span>, then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">must be grounded in faith</span></span>.
The inevitable must be to us the appointment of Omniscient
Love. In our childhood the very regimen and
discipline that were least to our taste proceeded often
from the wisest counsels, and in due time we acquiesced
in them as judicious and kind, nor would we in
the retrospect have had them otherwise. As little as
we then knew what was best for our well-being in the
nearer future, we may now know as to what is best
for us in a remote future, whether in the present or
in a higher state of being. All that remains for us is
acquiescence, cheerful and hopeful, in a Wisdom that
cannot err, in a Love which can will only the best of
which we are capable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Submission</span></span> is not merely a passive, but equally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">an active virtue</span></span>. Inevitable events impose imperative
duties. In the direction which they indicate
there is work for us, of self-culture, of kindness, of
charity. Our characters can be developed, not by
yielding, however cheerfully, to what seem misfortunes,
but by availing ourselves of the opportunities
which they present, in place of those of which they
have deprived us. When the way we had first
chosen is barred against us, we are not to lie still, but
to move onward with added diligence on the way that
is thus opened to us. If outward success is arrested
and reverted, there is only the more reason for improving
the staple of our inward being. If those
dearest to us have passed beyond the reach of our
good offices, there are the more remote that may be
brought near, and made ours, by our beneficence.
If our earthly life is rendered desolate, the affections,
hopes, and aims thus unearthed may by our spiritual
industry and thrift be trained heavenward. All this
is included in full submission to the will of the Divine
providence; for that will is not our loss, disappointment,
or suffering, but our growth, by means of it, in
quantity of mental and spiritual life, in capacity of
duty, and in the power of usefulness.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Courage</span></span> is preëminently an active virtue. Patience
resigns itself to what must be endured; submission
conforms itself to what it gladly would, but cannot
reverse; courage resists what it cannot evade, surmounts
what it cannot remove, and declines no conflict
in which it is honorable to engage. It is obvious
that the occasions for these virtues are widely different.
Patience has its place where calm and cheerful
endurance is the only resource; submission, where
there must be voluntary self-adaptation to altered
circumstances; courage, where there is threatened
evil which strenuous effort can avert, mitigate, or
subdue.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Courage is a virtue, only when it is a necessity.</span></span>
There is no merit in seeking danger, in exciting opposition,
in courting hostility. Indeed, conduct of
this description more frequently proceeds from persons
who know themselves cowards and fear to be
thought so, than from those who are actually possessed
of courage. But there are perils, encounters,
enmities, which cannot by any possibility be avoided,
and there are others which can be avoided only by
the sacrifice of principle, or by the surrender of opportunities
for doing good, and which, therefore, to a
virtuous man are inevitable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">physical courage</span></span>, commonly so called, which
is prompt and fearless in the presence of imminent
danger, or in armed conflict with enemies, may be, or
may not be, a virtue. It may proceed from a mind
too shallow and frivolous to appreciate the worth of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
life or the magnitude of the peril that threatens it;
it may, as often in the case of veteran soldiers, be the
result of discipline without the aid of principle; or it
may depend wholly on intense and engrossing excitement,
so that he who would march fearlessly at the
head of a forlorn hope might quail before a solitary
foe. But if one be, in the face of peril, at the same
time calm and resolute, self-collected and firm, cautious
and bold, fully aware of all that he must encounter
and unfalteringly brave in meeting it, such
courage is a high moral attainment. Its surest source
is trust in the Divine providence,—the fixed conviction
that the inevitable cannot be otherwise than of
benignant purpose and ministry, though that purpose
may be developed and that ministry effected only in
a higher state of being. To this faith must be added
a strong sense of one's manhood, and of his superiority
by virtue of that manhood over all external surroundings
and events. We are conscious of a rightful supremacy
over the outward world, and deem it unworthy
to succumb, without internecine resistance, to
any force by which we may be assailed, whether that
force be a power of nature or a wrongful assault from
a fellow-man. It is the presence of this consciousness
that wins our admiration for all genuine heroism, and
the absence of it at the moment of need that makes
cowardice contemptible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">moral courage</span></span> required in pursuing our
legitimate course in life, or in discharging our manifest
duty, notwithstanding straitnesses, hindrances,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obstacles, to which the feeble and timid could not but
yield. The constituent elements of this type of courage
are precisely the same that are needed in the encounter
with physical peril. In both cases it is
equally unmanly to succumb until we have resisted to
the utmost. But while physical courage can at best
only insure our safety, moral courage contributes essentially
to the growth of mind and character; and
the larger the opportunity for its exercise, the greater
will be the mass of mind, the quantity of character,
the power of duty and of usefulness. Straitnesses
develop richer resources than they bar. Hindrances
nurture hardihood of spirit in the struggle against
them, or in the effort to neutralize them. Obstacles,
when surmounted, give one a higher position than
could be attained on an unobstructed path. The
school of difficulty is that in which we have our most
efficient training for eminence, whether of capacity or
of moral excellence. What are accounted inevitable
evils are, when met with courage, only benefits and
blessings, inasmuch as they bring into full and vigorous
exercise the hardier muscles and sinews of the
inner man, to measure strength with them or to rise
above them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Courage is needed in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the profession and maintenance
of the true and the right</span></span>, when denied, assailed,
or vilipended. Communities never move abreast in
the progress of opinion. There are always pioneer
minds and consciences; and the men who are in advance
of their time must encounter obloquy at least,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
often persecution, loss, hardship, sometimes legal penalties
and disabilities. Under such circumstances,
there are doubtless many more that inwardly acknowledge
the unpopular truth or the contested right,
than there are who are willing to avow and defend
their belief. Many are frightened into false utterance
or deceptive silence. But there must be in such
minds a conscious mendacity, fatal to their own self-respect,
and in the highest degree detrimental to their
moral selfhood. It demands and at the same time
nurtures true greatness of soul to withstand the current
of general opinion, to defy popular prejudice, to
make one's self <span class="tei tei-q">“of no reputation”</span> in order to preserve
his integrity unimpaired. Therefore is it that,
in the lapse of time, the very men who have been
held in the lowest esteem rise into eminence in the
general regard, sometimes while they are still living,
oftener with a succeeding generation. Martyrs in
their day, they receive the crown of martyrdom when
the work which they commenced is consummated.
The history of all the great reforms which have been
successive eras in the moral progress of Christendom
is full of names, once dishonored, now among the
foremost of their race.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This type of courage has, in less enlightened ages
than our own, been made illustrious by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">those who
have sacrificed life rather than deny or suppress
beliefs</span></span> which they deemed of vital moment. It can
hardly be anticipated that the civilized world will
recede so far into barbarism as to light again the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
death-flame of persecution; but it may be questioned
whether the chronic sacrifice of all which men most
desire in life requires or manifests less of heroism than
in earlier times furnished victims for the arena or the
stake.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the moral hierarchy the first rank is probably
due to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the courage that inspires and sustains arduous
and perilous philanthropic enterprise</span></span>. The
martyr for opinion suffers or dies rather than stain
his soul with the positive guilt of falsehood; while
the philanthropist might evade toil and danger without
committing any actual sin, or making himself
liable to censure or disapproval either from God or
man. In the former case, hardship or danger is rendered
inevitable by the felt necessity of self-respect;
in the latter, by the urgency of a love for man equal
or superior to the love for self. As examples of
this highest type of courage, it may suffice to name
Howard, whose labors for prison-reform were pursued
at the well-known risk and the ultimate cost of his

inaugurated by her, who have won all the untarnished

There are many duties that are self-defined and
self-limited. Thus, the ordinary acts of justice and
many of the charities of daily life include in themselves
the designation of time, place, and measure.
There are other duties, of equal obligation, which
admit of wide variance as to these particulars, but
which can be most worthily and efficiently performed
only when reference is had to them. There are, also,
many acts, in themselves morally indifferent, which
acquire their moral character as right or wrong solely
from one or more of these particulars. Thus recreations
that are innocent and fitting on Saturday, may
be inconsistent with the proprieties of Sunday; conversation
and conduct perfectly befitting the retirement
of home may be justly offensive in a place of
public concourse; or there may be great guilt in the
excessive use of that which used in moderation may
be blameless, fitting, and salutary.

Hence the fitness, and therefore the duty, of a careful
economy of time. This economy can be secured only
by a systematic arrangement of one's hours of labor,
relaxation, and rest, and the assignment to successive
portions of the day, week, or year, of their appropriate
uses. The amount of time wasted, even by an industrious
man who has no method or order in his industry,
bears a very large proportion to the time profitably
employed. In the needlessly frequent change
of occupations, there is at each beginning and ending
a loss of the working power, which can neither start
on a new career at full speed, nor arrest itself without
previous slackening. This waste is made still
greater by the suspense or vacillation of purpose of
those who not only have no settled plans of industry,
but often know not what to do, or are liable, so soon
as they are occupied in one way, to feel themselves
irresistibly drawn in a different direction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in the distribution of time <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">a man should be
the master, not the slave of his system</span></span>. The regular
work and the actual duty of the moment do not
always coincide. Due care for health, the opportunity
for earned and needed recreation, the claims
of charity, courtesy, and hospitality, in fine, the immediate
urgency of any duty selfward, manward, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Godward, should always take precedence of routine-work
however wisely planned. Obstinate adherence
to system may lead to more and greater criminal
omissions of duty than would be incurred, even in the
spasmodic industry which takes its impulse from the
passing moment. It must be remembered that timeliness
is the essential element of right and obligation
in many things that ought to be done, especially in
all forms of charity, alike in great services, and in
those lesser amenities and kindnesses which contribute
so largely to the charm of society and the happiness
of domestic life. There are many good offices which,
performed too late, were better left undone,—courtesies
which, postponed, are incivilities,—attentions
which, out of season, are needless and wearisome.

it is unwise and unfitting. The morrow has its own
appropriate duties; and if to-day's work be thrown
into it, the massing of two days' good work into one
exceeds ordinary ability. The consequence is, either
that both days' works are imperfectly performed, or
that part of what fitly belongs to the morrow is
pushed farther on, and the derangement of duty made
chronic. Thus there are persons who are always in
arrears with their engagements and occupations,—in
chase, as it were, after duties which they never lose

intensifies an uneasy, self-distrusting frame of mind,
unfavorable to vigorous effort, and still more so to the

as to time,—exactness to a moment in the observance
of all times that can be designated or agreed upon.
In matters with which we alone are concerned, we
undoubtedly have of right, and may often very fittingly
exercise, the dispensing power. Thus, in the
arrangement of our own pursuits, the clock may
measure and direct our industry, without binding us
by its stroke. It is often of more consequence that
we finish what is almost done, than that we change
our work because the usual hour for a change has
arrived. But where others are concerned, rigid
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
punctuality is an imperative duty. A fixed time for
an assembly, a meeting of a committee or board of
trust, or a business interview, is a virtual contract
into which each person concerned has entered with
every other, and the strict rules that apply to contracts
of all kinds are applicable here. Failure in
punctuality is dishonesty. It involves the theft of
time, which to some men is money's worth, to others
is worth more than money. It ought not to surprise
us if one wantonly or habitually negligent in this
matter should prove himself oblivious of other and
even more imperative obligations; for the dullness of
conscience and the obscure sense of right, indicated
by the frequent breach of virtual contracts as to time,
betoken a character too feeble to maintain its integrity
against any strong temptation.

The trite maxim, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">A place for everything, and
everything in its place</span></span>, so commends itself to the
sense of fitness, as hardly to need exposition or enforcement;
yet while no maxim is more generally
admitted, scarce any is so frequently violated in practice.
In duty, the elements of time and place are intimately
blended. Disorder in place generates derangement
in time. The object which is out of place
can be found only by the waste of time; and the most
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
faithful industry loses a large part of its value when
its materials are wanting where they ought to be, and
must be sought where they ought not to be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Apart from considerations of utility, order is an
æsthetic duty. It is needed to satisfy the sense of
beauty. Its violation offends the eye, insults the
taste. The æsthetic nature craves and claims culture.
It has abundant provision made for it in external
nature; but so large a part of life must be passed
within doors, at least in a climate like ours, that it is
starved and dwarfed, if there be not in interior arrangements
some faint semblance of the symmetry
and harmony of the universe. To effect this needs
neither abundance nor costliness of material. A
French man or woman will charm the eye at a cost
which in England would be represented by bare and
squalid poverty. A Parisian shop-window will make
with a few francs' worth of goods an exhibition of
artistical beauty which might challenge the most fastidious
criticism. These effects are produced solely
by prime reference to fitness of place,—to orderly
arrangement,—to a symmetry which all can understand,
and which any one might copy. Our very
capacity of receiving gratification from this source is
the measure of our duty in this regard. If with the
simplest materials we can give pleasure to the soul
through the eye by merely assigning its fit place to
every object, order is among the plainest dictates of
beneficence.

earliest and surest nurture in domestic life. There
are homes at once affluent and joyless, groaning with
needless waste and barren of needed comfort, in which
the idea of repose seems as irrelevant as Solomon's
figure of lying down on the top of a mast, and all
from a pervading spirit of disorder. In such dwellings
there is no love of home. The common house is
a mere lodging and feeding place. Society is sought
elsewhere, pleasure elsewhere; and for the young and
easily impressible there is the strongest inducement
to those modes of dissipation in which vice conceals
its grossness behind fair exteriors and under attractive
forms. On the other hand, the well-ordered
house affords to its inmates the repose, comfort, and
enjoyment which they crave and need, and for those
whose characters are in the process of formation may
neutralize allurements to evil which might else be
irresistible.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are many objects, as to which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the question
of duty is a question of more or less</span></span>. To this class
belong not only food and drink, but all forms of luxury,
indulgence, recreation, and amusement. In all
these the choice lies between excess, abstinence, and
temperance. The tendency to excess is intensely
strong, when not restrained by prudence or principle.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This tendency is by no means confined to the appetite
for intoxicating liquors, though modern usage has
restricted to excess in this particular the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">intemperance</span></span>,
which properly bears a much more extended
signification. There is reason to believe that there is
fully as much intemperance in food as in drink, and
with at least equally ruinous consequences as to capacity,
character, health, and life,—with this difference
only, that gluttony stupefies and stultifies, while
drunkenness maddens; and that the glutton is merely
a dead weight on the community, while the drunkard
is an active instrument of annoyance and peril.
There are probably fewer who sink into an absolutely
beastly condition by intemperance in food than by
intemperance in drink; but of persons who do not
expose themselves to open scandal, those whose brains
are muddled, whose sensibilities are coarsened, and
whose working power is impaired by over-eating, are
more numerous than those in whom similar effects
are produced by over-free indulgence in intoxicating
drinks. Intemperance in amusements, also, is not
uncommon, and would undoubtedly be more prevalent
than it is, were not the inevitable necessity of
labor imposed on most persons from a very early
period. In this matter the limit between temperance
and excess is aptly fixed by the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">recreation</span></span>, as
applied to all the gay and festive portions of life.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-creation</span></span> is making over, that is, replacing the
waste of tissue, brain-power, and physical and mental
energy occasioned by hard work. Temperance permits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the most generous indulgence of sport, mirth,
and gayety that can be claimed as needful or conducive
to this essential use, but excludes all beyond this
measure.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Abstinence</span></span> from all forms of luxury and recreation,
and from food and drink beyond the lowest demands
of subsistence, has, under various cultures, been regarded
as a duty, as an appropriate penance for sin,
as a means of spiritual growth, as a token of advanced
excellence. This notion had its origin in the dualistic
philosophy or theology of the East. It was believed
that the sovereignty of the universe was divided
between the semi-omnipotent principles of good and
evil, and that the earth and the human body were
created by the evil principle,—by Satan or his analogue.
Hence it was inferred that the evil principle
could be abjured and defied, and the good principle
propitiated in no way so effectually as by renouncing
the world and mortifying the body. Fasting, as a religious
observance, originated in this belief. It was
imported from the East. The Hebrew fasts were not
established by Moses; they were evidently borrowed
from Babylon, and seem to have been regarded with
no favor by the prophets. The Founder of Christianity
prescribed no fast, nor have we any reason to
believe that his immediate disciples regarded abstinence
as a duty. Christian asceticism in all its forms
is, like the Jewish fasts, of Oriental origin, and had
its first developments in close connection with those
hybrids of Christianity and Oriental philosophy of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which the dualism already mentioned forms a prominent
feature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to all objects of appetite, desire, and
enjoyment, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">temperance</span></span> is evidently fitting, and therefore
a duty, unless there be specific reasons for abstinence.
Temperance demands and implies moral
activity. In the temperate man the appetites, desires,
and tastes have their continued existence, and need
vigilant and wise control, so that he has always work
to do, a warfare to wage; and as conflict with the
elements gives vigor to the body, so does conflict with
the body add strength continually to the moral nature.
The ascetic may have a hard struggle at the outset;
but his aim is to extirpate his imagined enemies in
the bodily affections, and when these are completely
mortified, or put to death, there remains no more for
him to do, and moral idleness and lethargy ensue.
Simon Stylites, who spent thirty-seven years on pillars
of different heights, had probably stupefied his
moral faculties and sensibilities as effectually as he
had crushed to death the appetites and cravings of
the body. It must not be forgotten that the body no
less than the soul is of God's building, and that in
his purpose all the powers and capacities of the body
are good in their place and uses, and therefore to be
controlled and governed, not destroyed or suppressed.
The mediæval saint, feeding on the offal of the streets,
was unwittingly committing sacrilege, by degrading
and imbruting an appetite for which God had provided
decent and wholesome nutriment.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Temperance is better than abstinence, also, because
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the moderate use of the objects of desire is a source
of refining and elevating influences</span></span>. It is not without
meaning that, in common speech, the possession
or loss of the senses is made synonymous with mental
sanity or derangement. By the temperate gratification
of the senses the mind is sustained in its freshness,
vigor, and serenity; while when they are perverted
by excess, impaired by age, or deadened by
disease, in that same proportion the mental powers
are distracted, enfeebled, or benumbed. Taste, the
faculty through which we become conversant with
the whole realm of beauty, and than which devotion
has no more efficient auxiliary, derives its name from
what the ascetic deems the lowest animal enjoyment,
which, however, has its range of the very highest
ministries. The table is the altar of home-love and
of hospitality, and there are clustered around it unnumbered
courtesies, kindnesses, and charities that
make a large part of the charm and joy of life. So
far is thoughtfulness for its graceful and generous
service from indicating a low type of character, that
there is hardly any surer index of refinement and elegant
culture than is furnished by the family meal.
Similar remarks apply to the entire range of pleasurable
objects and experiences. While there are none
of them in which excess is safe, they all, when enjoyed
in moderation, stimulate the mental powers,
develop and train the æsthetic faculty, and multiply
beneficial relations alike with nature and with society.

grounds connected with social economy</span></span>. Labor
for the mere necessaries of life occupies hardly a tithe
of human industry. A nation of ascetics would be a
nation of idlers. It is the demand for objects of enjoyment,
taste, luxury, that floats ships, dams rivers,
stimulates invention, feeds prosperity, and creates the
wealth of nations. It is only excess and extravagance
that sustain and aggravate social inequalities, wrongs,
wants, and burdens; while moderate, yet generous
use oils the springs and speeds the wheels of universal
industry, progress, comfort, and happiness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Past excess</span></span> may render temperance hardly possible.
From the derangement consequent upon excess,
an appetite may lose the capacity of healthy exercise.
In such a case, as we would amputate a diseased and
useless limb, we should suppress the appetite which
we can no longer control. Physiological researches
have shown that the excessive use of intoxicating
drinks, when long continued, produces an organic condition,
in which the slightest indulgence is liable to
excite a craving so intense as to transcend the control
of the will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Inherited proclivities</span></span> may, in like manner, render
temperance so difficult as to make abstinence a duty.
It is conceivable that a nation or a community may,
by the prevalence of excess in past generations, be
characterized by so strong a tendency to intemperance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as to render general abstinence a prerequisite to general
temperance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Abstinence may also become a duty, if to many
around us our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">example</span></span> in what we may enjoy innocently
would be ensnaring and perilous. The recreation,
harmless in itself, which by long abuse has become
a source of corruption, it may be our duty to
forego. The indulgence, safe for us, which would be
unsafe for our associates, it may be incumbent on us
to resign. The food, the drink which would make
our table a snare to our guests, we may be bound to
refrain from, though for ourselves there be in it no
latent evil or lurking danger. This, however, is a
matter in which each person must determine his duty
for himself alone, and in which no one is authorized
to legislate for others. It may seem to a conscientious
man a worthy enterprise to vindicate and rescue
from its evil associations an amusement or indulgence
in itself not only harmless, but salutary; and there
may be an equally strong sense of right on both sides
of a question of social morality falling under this
head. The joyous side of life must be maintained.
The young, sanguine, and happy will at all events
have recreations, games, festivities, and of these there
is not a single element, material, or feature that has
not been abused, perverted, or invested with associations
offensive to a pure moral taste. To disown and
oppose them all in the name of virtue, is to prescribe
a degree of abstinence which can have the assent of
those only who have outlived the capacity of enjoyment.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The more judicious course is to favor, or at
least to tolerate such modes of indulgence as may for
the present be the least liable to abuse, or such as
may in prospect be the safest in their moral influence,
and by sanctioning these to render more emphatic and
efficient the disapproval and rejection of such as are
intrinsically wrong and evil.

The ancients had but one word for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">manners and
morals</span></span>. It might be well if the same were the case
with us,—yet with this essential difference, that
while they degraded morals to the level of manners, a
higher culture would lead us to raise manners to the
level of morals. The main characteristics of good
manners are comprised in the three preceding Sections.
They are the observance, in one's demeanor
and conduct toward others, of the fitnesses of time
and place, and of the due and graceful mean between
overwrought, extravagant, or fantastic manifestations
of regard on the one hand, and coldness, superciliousness,
or indifference on the other. Courtesies, like
more substantial kindnesses, are neutralized by delay,
and, when slow, seem forced and reluctant. Attentions,
which in their place are gratifying, may, if
misplaced, occasion only mortification and embarrassment,
as when civilities befitting interior home-life
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are rehearsed for the public eye and ear. Nor is
there any department of conduct in which excess or
deficiency is more painfully felt,—a redundance of
compliments and assiduities tending to silence and
abash the recipient, while their undue scanting inflicts
a keen sense of slight, neglect, and injury.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Politeness</span></span> must, indeed, in order even to appear
genuine, be the expression of sincere kindness. There
is no pretence so difficult to maintain as the false show
of genial and benevolent feeling. The mask cannot
be so fitted to the face as not to betray its seams and
sutures. Yet kindness is not of itself politeness. Its
spontaneous expressions may be rude and awkward;
or they may take forms not readily understood and
appreciated. There are conventional modes of polite
demeanor no less than of courteous speech. These
modes may have no intrinsic fitness, yet they acquire
a fitness from their long and general use; and while
the mere repetition of stereotyped formulas whether
in word or deportment is justly offensive, he who
would have his politeness recognized and enjoyed
must beware lest he depart too widely from the
established sign-language of society. There is a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">brusquerie</span></span> often underlying hearty kindness and good
fellowship, which at the outset pains, wounds, and
repels those brought within its sphere, and which the
most intimate friends endure and excuse rather than

who cultivate discourtesy, are acrid or bitter in their
very deeds of charity, and carry into every society a
certain porcupine selfhood, which makes their mere

the suffering they inflict on individuals, are of
unspeakable injury to their respective circles or communities,
by making their very virtues unlovely, and
piety, if they profess it, hateful. On the other hand,
there is no truer benefactor to society—if the creation
of happiness be the measure of benefit—than
the genuine gentleman or gentlewoman, who adds
grace to virtue, politeness to kindness; who under the

endeavors to render to all their due, and in the least
details that can affect another's happiness, does carefully
and conscientiously all that the most fastidious

perfect state of society, government would still be
necessary; for it would be only by the observance of
common and mutual designations of time, place, and
measure, that each individual member of society could
enjoy the largest liberty and the fullest revenue from
objects of desire, compatible with the just claims and
rights of others. These benefits can, under no conceivable
condition in which finite beings can be placed,
be secured except by system, under a central administration,
and with the submission of individual wills
and judgments to constituted and established authority.
A bad government, then, is better than

a part of its appropriate work, while in a state of
anarchy the whole of that work is left undone and
unattempted.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Obedience to government is</span></span>, then, fitting, and
therefore a duty, independently of all considerations
as to the wisdom, or even the justice of its decrees or
statutes. If they are unwise, they yet are rules to
which the community can conform itself, and by
which its members can make their plans and govern
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their expectations, while lawlessness is the negation
alike of guidance for the present and of confidence in
the future. If they are unjust, they yet do less wrong
and to fewer persons, than would be done by individual
and sporadic attempts to evade or neutralize them.
Nay, unwise and inequitable laws, to which the habits
and the industrial relations of a people have adjusted
themselves, are to be preferred to vacillating legislation,
though in a generally right direction. Laws
that affect important interests should be improved
only with reference to the virtual pledges made by
previous legislation, and so as to guard the interests
involved against the injurious effects of new and revolutionary
measures. The tariff regulations of our
own country will illustrate the bearing of this principle.
It forms no part of our present plan to discuss
the mooted questions of free trade and protection.
But in the confession of even extreme partisans on
either side, the capital and industry of our people could
never have suffered so much from any one tariff of duties,
however injudicious, as they suffered for a series
of years from sudden changes of policy, by which investments
that had been invited by the legislation of
one Congress were made fruitless by the action of the
next, and manufactures stimulated into rapid growth
by high protective duties, were arrested and often
ruined by their sudden repeal. The stability of laws
is obviously a higher good than their conformity to
the theoretical views of the more enlightened citizens.
Except under a despotism, laws are virtually an expression
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the opinion or will of the majority; and
laws which by any combination of favoring circumstances
are enacted in advance of the general opinion,
are always liable to speedy repeal, with a double
series of the injurious consequences which can hardly
fail to ensue immediately on any change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But are there no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">limits to obedience</span></span>? Undoubtedly
there are. A bad law is to be obeyed for the
sake of order; an immoral law is to be disobeyed for
the sake of the individual conscience; and of the
moral character of a particular law, or of action under
it, the individual conscience is the only legitimate
judge. Where the law of the land and absolute right
are at variance, the citizen is bound, not only to withhold
obedience, but to avow his belief, and to give it
full expression in every legitimate form and way, by
voice and pen, by private influence and through the
ballot-box. But in the interest of the public order,
it is his duty to confine his opposition to legal and
constitutional methods, to refrain from factious and
seditious resistance, to avoid, if possible, the emergency
in which disobedience would become his duty,
and in case his conscience constrains him to disobedience,
still to show his respect for the majesty of law
by quietly submitting to its penalty. The still recent
history of our country furnishes a case in point. By
the Fugitive-Slave Law—which the Divine providence,
indeed, repealed without waiting for the action
of Congress—the private citizen who gave shelter,
sustenance, or comfort to a fugitive slave; who,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
knowing his hiding-place, omitted to divulge it, or
who, when called upon to assist in arresting him, refused
his aid, was made liable to a heavy fine and a
long imprisonment. Now as to this law, it was obviously
the duty of a citizen who regarded the slave as
entitled to the rights of a man, to seek its repeal by
all constitutional methods within his power. It was
equally his duty to refrain from all violent interference
with the functionaries charged with its execution, and
to avoid, if possible, all collision with the government.
But if, without his seeking, a fugitive slave had been
cast upon his humane offices, the question then would
have arisen whether he should obey God or man; and
to this question he could have had but one answer. Yet
his obedience to God would have lacked its crowning
grace, if he had not meekly yielded to the penalty for
his disobedience to the law of the land. It was by
this course that the primitive Christians attested their
loyalty at once to God and to <span class="tei tei-q">“the powers that be,”</span>
which were <span class="tei tei-q">“ordained of God.”</span> They refused obedience
to the civil authorities in matters in which
their religious duty was compromised; but they neither
resisted nor evaded the penalty for their disobedience.
Similar was the course of the Quakers in
England and America almost down to our own time.
They were quiet and useful citizens, performing the
same functions with their fellow-citizens, so far as
their consciences permitted, and, where conscience interposed
its veto, taking patiently the distraining of
their goods, and the imprisonment of their bodies,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
until, by their blameless lives and their meek endurance,
they won from the governments both of the
mother country and of the United States, amnesty
for their conscientious scruples.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There may be a state of society in which it becomes
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the duty of good citizens to assume an illegal
attitude, and to perform illegal acts, in the interest
of law and order</span></span>. If those who are legally intrusted
with executive and judicial offices are openly,
notoriously, and persistently false to their trusts, to
such a degree as to derange and subvert the social
order which it is their function to maintain, good citizens,
if they have the power, have undoubtedly the
right to displace them, and to institute a provisional
government for the temporary emergency. A case of
this kind occurred a few years ago in San Francisco.
The entire government of the city had for a series of
years been under the control of ruffians and miscreants,
and force and fraud had rendered the ballot-box
an ineffectual remedy. No law-abiding citizen deemed
his life or property safe; gross outrages were committed
with impunity; and thieves and murderers alone
had the protection of the municipal authorities. Despairing
of legal remedy, the best citizens of all parties
organized themselves under the direction of a Committee
of Safety, forcibly deposed the municipal magistrates
and judges, brought well-known criminals to
trial, conviction, and punishment, reëstablished the
integrity of suffrage, and resigned their power to
functionaries lawfully elected, under whom and their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
successors the city has enjoyed a degree of order,
tranquillity, and safety at least equal to that of any
other great city on the continent.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The right of revolution</span></span> undoubtedly is inherent
in a national body politic; but it is an extreme right,
and is to be exercised only under the most urgent necessity.
Its conditions cannot be strictly defined, and
its exercise can, perhaps, be justified only by its results.
A constitutional government can seldom furnish occasion
for violent revolutionary measures; for every
constitution has its own provisions for legal amendment,
and the public sentiment ripe for revolution can
hardly fail to be strong enough to carry the amendments
which it craves, through the legal processes,
which, if slow and cumbrous, are immeasurably preferable
to the employment of force and the evils of civil
war. On the other hand, a despotic or arbitrary government
may admit of abrogation only by force; and
if its administration violates private rights, imposes
unrighteous burdens and disabilities, suppresses the
development of the national resources, and supersedes
the administration of justice or the existence of equitable
relations between class and class or between
man and man, the people—the rightful source and
arbiter of government—has manifestly the right to
assert its own authority, and to substitute a constitution
and rulers of its own choice for the sovereignty
which has betrayed its trust. Under similar oppression,
the same right unquestionably exists in a remote
colony, or in a nation subject by conquest to a foreign
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
power. If that power refuses the rights and privileges
of subjects to a people over which it exercises
sovereignty, and governs it in its own imagined interests,
with a systematic and persistent disregard to the
well-being of the people thus governed, resistance is
a right, and may become a duty. In fine, the function
of government is the maintenance of just and
beneficent order; a government forfeits its rights
when it is false to this function; and the rights thus
forfeited revert to the misgoverned people.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Casuistry is the application of the general principles
of morality to individual <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cases</span></span> in which there
is room for question as to duty. The question may be
as to the obligation or the rightfulness of a particular
act, as to the choice between two alternative courses,
as to the measure or limit of a recognized duty, or as
to the grounds of preference when there seems to be
a conflict of duties. A large proportion of these cases
disappear under any just view of moral obligation.
Most questions of conscience have their origin in deficient
conscientiousness. He who is determined to
do the right, the whole right, and nothing but the
right, is seldom at a loss to know what he ought to
do. But when the aim is to evade all difficult duties
which can be omitted without shame or the clear consciousness
of wrong, and to go as close as possible to
the boundary line between good and evil without
crossing it, the questions that arise are often perplexing
and complicated, and they are such as, in the
interest of virtue, may fittingly remain unanswered.
There are always those whose aim is, not to attain
any definite, still less any indefinitely high, standard
of goodness, but to be saved from the penal consequences
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of wrong-doing; and there are even (so-called)
religious persons, and teachers too, with whom
this negative indemnity from punishment fills out the
whole meaning of the sacred and significant term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">salvation</span></span>.
It must be confessed that questions which
could emanate only from such minds, furnish a very
large part of the often voluminous and unwieldy treatises
on casuistry that have come down to us from
earlier times, especially of those of the Jesuit moralists,
whose chief endeavor is to lay out a border-path
just outside the confines of acknowledged wrong and
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet there are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">cases in which the most conscientious
persons may be in doubt as to the right</span></span>.
We can here indicate only the general principles on
which such cases are to be decided, with a very few
specific illustrations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The question of duty is often a question</span></span>, not
of principle, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">of fact</span></span>. It is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">case</span></span>,
the position and relations of the persons or objects concerned, that
we do not fully understand. For instance, when a
new appeal is made for our charitable aid, in labor or
money, the question is not whether it is our duty to
assist in a work of real beneficence, but whether for
the proposed object, and under the direction of those
who make the appeal, our labor or money will be
lucratively invested in the service of humanity. There
are, certainly, benevolent associations and enterprises
for the very noblest ends, whose actual utility is open
to the gravest doubt. It is sometimes difficult even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to determine a question of justice or equity, simply
because the circumstances of the case, so far as we
can understand them, do not define the right. Instances
of this class might be multiplied; but they
are all instances in which there is no obscurity as to
our obligation or duty, and therefore no question for
moral casuistry. We are, however, obviously bound,
by considerations of fitness, to seek the fullest information
within our power in every case in which we
are compelled to act, or see fit to act; nor can we
regard action without knowledge, even though the
motive be virtuous, as either safe or blameless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The measure or limit of duty</span></span> is with many conscientious
persons a serious question. Here an exact
definition is hardly possible, and a generous liberty
may be given to individual taste or judgment; yet
considerations of fitness set bounds to that liberty.
Thus direct and express self-culture is a duty incumbent
on all, yet in which diversity of inclination may
render very different degrees of diligence equally fitting
and right; but all self-centred industry is fittingly
limited by domestic, social, and civic obligations.
Thus, also, direct acts of beneficence are obviously
incumbent on all; but the degree of self-sacrifice for
beneficent ends need not, nay, ought not to be the
same for every one; and while we hold in the highest
admiration those who make the entire surrender of all
that they have and are to the service of mankind, we
have no reason to scant our esteem for those who are
simply kind and generous, while they at the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time labor, spend, or save for their own benefit. Indeed,
the world has fully as much need of the latter
as of the former. Were the number of self-devoting
philanthropists over-large, a great deal of the necessary
business and work of life would be left undone;
and did self-denying givers constitute a very numerous
body, the dependent and mendicant classes would
be much more numerous than they are; while the
withdrawal of expenditure for personal objects would
paralyze industrial enterprise, and arrest the creation
of that general wealth which contributes to the general
comfort and happiness, and the accumulation of
those large fortunes which are invaluable as safety-funds
and movement-funds for the whole community.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are cases in which there is manifestly a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">conflict
of duties</span></span>. This most frequently occurs between
prudence and beneficence. Up to a certain point they
coincide. No prudent man will suffer himself to contract
unsocial, or selfish, or miserly habits, or to neglect
the ordinary good offices and common charities of
life. But is one bound to transcend the limits of prudence,
and, without any specific grounds of personal
obligation, to incur loss, hardship, or peril, in behalf
of another person? One is no doubt bound to do all
that he could reasonably expect from another, were
their positions reversed; but is it his duty to do more
than this? In answer, it must be admitted that he
who in such a case suffers prudence to limit his beneficence
has done all that duty absolutely requires; but,
in proportion to the warmth of his benevolence and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the loftiness of his spirit and character, he will find
himself constrained to transcend this limit, and to sacrifice
prudence to beneficence. Thus—to take an instance
from a class of events by no means infrequent—if
I see a man in danger of drowning, it is obviously
my duty to do all that I can do for his rescue
without putting my own life in jeopardy. But I owe
him no more than this. My own life is precious to
me and to my family, and I have a right so to regard
it. I shall not deserve censure or self-reproach, if I
decline exposing myself to imminent peril. Yet if I
have the generosity and the courage which belong to
a truly noble nature, I shall not content myself with
doing no more than this,—I shall hazard my own
safety if there is reason to hope that my efforts may
have a successful issue; and in so doing I shall perform
an act of heroic virtue. The same principle
will apply to exposure, danger, and sacrifice of every
kind, incurred for the safety, relief, or benefit of
others. We transgress no positive law of right, when
we omit doing for others more than we could rightfully
expect were we in their place. Prudence in
such a case is our right. But it is a right which it is
more noble to surrender than to retain; and the readiness
with which and the degree in which we are willing
to surrender it, may be taken as a fair criterion of
our moral growth and strength.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Justice</span></span>, with the broad scope
which we have given to it, there may be an apparent
conflict of duties, and there are certain obvious laws
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of precedence which may cover all such cases. We
should first say that our obligations to the Supreme
Being have a paramount claim above all duties to inferior
beings, had we not reason to believe that God
is in no way so truly worshipped and served as by
acts of justice and mercy to his children. The Divine
Teacher has given us to understand, not that there is
no time or place too sacred for charity, but that holy
times and places have their highest consecration in
the love to man which love to God inspires.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Toward men, it hardly needs to be said that justice
(in the limited and ordinary acceptation of the
word) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">has the precedence of charity</span></span>. Indeed, were
it not for the prevalence of injustice—individual,
social, and civic—there would hardly be any scope
for the active exercise of charity. Want comes almost
wholly from wrong. Were justice universal, that is,
were the rights and privileges which fitly belong to
men as men, extended to and made available by all
classes and conditions of men, there would still be
great inequalities of wealth and of social condition;
but abject and squalid poverty could hardly exist. In
almost every individual instance, the withholding or
delay of justice tends more or less directly toward the
creation of the very evils which charity relieves. No
amount of generosity, then, can palliate injustice, or
stand as a substitute for justice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As regards the persons to whom we owe offices of
kindness or charity, it is obvious that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">those related
to us by consanguinity or affinity have the first
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-weight: 700">
claim</span></span>. These relations have all the elements of a
natural alliance for mutual defence and help; and it is
impossible that their essential duties should be faithfully
discharged and their fitnesses duly observed,
without creating sympathies that in stress of need
will find expression in active charity. In the next
rank we may fittingly place our benefactors, if their
condition be such as to demand a return for their
kind offices in our behalf. Nearness in place may be
next considered; for the very fact that the needs of
our neighbors are or may be within our cognizance,
commends them especially to our charity, and enables
us to be the more judicious and effective in their relief.
Indeed, in smaller communities, where the dwellings
of the rich and of the poor are interspersed, a general
recognition of the claims of neighborhood on charity
would cover the field of active beneficence with an
efficiency attainable in no other way, and at a greatly
diminished cost of time and substance. There is yet
another type of neighborhood, consecrated to our reverent
observance by the parable of the Good Samaritan.
There are from time to time cases of want and
suffering brought, without our seeking, under our immediate
regard,—cast, as it were, directly upon our
kind offices. The person thus commended to us is,
for the time, our nearest neighbor, nay, our nearest
kinsman, and the very circumstances which have
placed him in this relation to us, make him fittingly
the foremost object of our charity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question sometimes presents itself <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">whether
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-weight: 700">
we shall bestow an immediate, yet transient benefit,
or a more remote, but permanent good</span></span>. If
the two are incompatible, and the former is not a
matter of absolute necessity, the latter is to be preferred.
Thus remunerative employment is much
more beneficial than alms to an able-bodied man, and
it is better that he suffer some degree of straitness till
he can earn a more comfortable condition, than that
he be first made to feel the dependence of pauperism.
Yet if his want be entire and urgent, the delay of
immediate relief is the part of cruelty. On similar
grounds, beneficence which embraces a class of cases
or persons is to be preferred to particular acts of
kindness to individuals. Thus it seems harsh to refuse
alms to an unknown street beggar; but as such
relief gives shelter to a vast amount of fraud, idleness,
and vice, it is much better that we should sustain, by
contributions proportioned to our ability, some system
by which cases of actual need, and such only, can be
promptly and adequately cared for, and that we then—however
reluctantly—refuse our alms to applicants
of doubtful merit.

The numerous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">ethical systems</span></span> that have had
currency in earlier or later times, may be divided
into two classes,—the one embracing those which
make virtue a means; the other, those which make
it an end. According to the former, virtue is to be
practised for the good that will come of it; according
to the latter, for its own sake, for its intrinsic excellence.
These classes have obvious subdivisions. The
former includes both the selfish and the utilitarian
theory; while the latter embraces a wide diversity of
views as to the nature, the standard, and the criterion
of virtue, according as it is believed to consist in
conformity to the fitness of things, in harmony with
an unsophisticated taste, in accordance with the interior
moral sense, or in obedience to the will of God.
There are, also, border theories, which blend, or rather
force into juxtaposition, the ideas that underlie the
two classes respectively.

Greece and Rome</span></span>, or rather, in Greece; for Rome
had no philosophy that was not born in Greece.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Socrates</span></span> was less a moral philosopher than a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
preacher of virtue. Self-ordained as a censor and reformer,
he directed his invective and irony principally
against the Sophists, whose chief characteristic as to
philosophy seems to have been the denial of objective
truth, and thus, of absolute and determinate right.
Socrates, in contrast with them, seeks to elicit duty
from the occasions for its exercise, making his collocutors
define right and obligation from the nature of
things as presented to their own consciousness and
reflection. Plato represents him, whenever a moral
question is under discussion, as probing the very heart
of the case, and drawing thence the response as from
a divine oracle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Plato</span></span> held essentially the same ground, as may be
seen in his identifying the True, the Beautiful, and
the Good; but it is impossible to trace in his writings
the outlines of a definite ethical system, whether his
own, or one derived from his great master.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">principal schools of ethical philosophy
in Greece</span></span> were the Peripatetic, the Epicurean,
and the Stoic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Peripatetics</span></span> derived their philosophy from
Aristotle, and their name from his habit of walking
up and down under the plane-trees of the Lyceum.
According to him, virtue is conduct so conformed to
human nature as to preserve all its appetites, proclivities,
desires, and passions, in mutual check and limitation.
It consists in shunning extremes. Thus
courage stands midway between cowardice and rashness;
temperance, between excess and self-denial;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
generosity, between prodigality and parsimony; meekness,
between irascibility and pusillanimity. Happiness
is regarded as the supreme good; but while this
is not to be attained without virtue, virtue alone will
not secure it. Happiness requires, in addition, certain
outward advantages, such as health, riches, friends,
which therefore a good man will seek by all lawful
means. Aristotle laid an intense stress on the cultivation
of the domestic virtues, justly representing the
household as the type, no less than the nursery, of
the state, and the political well-being of the state as
contingent on the style of character cherished and
manifested in the home-life of its members.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is reason to believe that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Aristotle's personal
character</span></span> was conformed to his theory of virtue,—that
he pursued the middle path, rather than
the more arduous route of moral perfection. Though
much of his time was spent in Athens, he was a native
of Macedonia, and was for several years resident at
the court of Philip as tutor to Alexander, with whom
he retained friendly relations for the greater part of
his royal pupil's life. Of his connection with the
Macedonian court and public affairs, there are several
stories that implicate him dishonorably with political
intrigues, and though there is not one of these that is
not denied, and not one which rests on competent historical
authority, such traditions are not apt so to
cluster as to blur the fair fame of a sturdily incorruptible
man, but are much more likely to cling to
the memory of a trimmer and a time-server.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Epicurus,</span></span> from whom the Epicurean philosophy
derives its name, was for many years a teacher of
philosophy in Athens. He was a man of simple, pure,
chaste, and temperate habits, in his old age bore severe
and protracted sufferings, from complicated and
incurable disease, with singular equanimity, and had
his memory posthumously blackened only by those
who—like theological bigots of more recent times—inferred,
in despite of all contemporary evidence, that
he was depraved in character, because they thought
that his philosophy ought to have made him so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He represented <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">pleasure as the supreme good</span></span>,
and its pleasure-yielding capacity as the sole criterion
by which any act or habit is to be judged. On
this ground, the quest of pleasure becomes the prime,
or rather the only duty. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do that you may enjoy,”</span>
is the fundamental maxim of morality. There is no
intrinsic or permanent distinction between right and
wrong. Individual experience alone can determine
the right, which varies according to the differences of
taste, temperament, or culture. There are, however,
some pleasures which are more than counterbalanced
by the pains incurred in procuring them, or by those
occasioned by them; and there are, also, pains which
are the means of pleasures greater than themselves.
The wise man, therefore, will measure and govern his
conduct, not by the pleasure of the moment, but with
reference to the future and ultimate effects of acts,
habits, and courses of conduct, upon his happiness.
What are called the virtues, as justice, temperance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chastity, are in themselves no better than their opposites;
but experience has shown that they increase
the aggregate of pleasure, and diminish the aggregate
of pain. Therefore, and therefore alone, they are
duties. The great worth of philosophy consists in its
enabling men to estimate the relative duration, and
the permanent consequences, as well as the immediate
intensity, of every form of pleasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Epicurus specifies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">two kinds of pleasure</span></span>, that of
rest and that of motion. He prefers the former.
Action has its reaction; excitement is followed by
depression; effort, by weariness; thought for others
involves the disturbance of one's own peace. The
gods, according to Epicurus, lead an easy, untroubled
life, leave the outward universe to take care of itself,
are wholly indifferent to human affairs, and are made
ineffably happy by the entire absence of labor, want,
and care; and man becomes most godlike and most
happy, therefore most virtuous, when he floats through
life, unharming and unharmed, idle and useless, self-contained
and self-sufficing, simple in his tastes, moderate
in his requirements, frugal in his habits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be doubted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">whether Epicurus denoted by
pleasure,</span><a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a><span style="font-weight: 700"> mere physical
pleasure alone</span></span>. It is certain
that his later followers regarded the pleasures of
the body as the only good; and Cicero says that Epicurus
himself referred all the pleasures of the intellect
to the memory of past and the hope of future
sensual gratification. Yet there is preserved an extract
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a letter from Epicurus, in which he says that
his own bodily pains in his years of decrepitude are
outweighed by the pleasure derived from the memory
of his philosophical labors and discoveries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Epicureanism numbered among its disciples</span></span>,
not only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">men of approved virtue</span></span>, but not a few,
like Pliny the Younger, of a more active type of virtue
than Epicurus would have deemed consistent
with pleasure. But in lapse of time it became the
pretext and cover for the grossest sensuality; and
the associations which the unlearned reader has with
the name are only strengthened by conversance with
the literature to which it gave birth. Horace is its
poet-laureate; and he was evidently as sincere in his
philosophy as he was licentious in his life. There is
a certain charm in good faith and honesty, even when
on the side of wrong and vice; and it is his perfect
frankness, self-complacency, nay, self-praise, in a
sensuality which in plain prose would seem by turns
vapid and disgusting, that makes Horace even perilously
fascinating, so that the guardians of the public
morals may well be thankful that for the young the
approach to him is warded off by the formidable barriers
of grammar and dictionary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While Epicureanism thus generated, on the one
hand, in men of the world laxity of moral principle
and habit, on the other hand, in minds of a more
contemplative cast, it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">lapsed into atheism</span></span>. From
otiose gods, careless of human affairs, the transition
was natural to a belief in no gods. The universe
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which could preserve and govern itself, could certainly
have sprung into uncaused existence; for the tendencies
which, without a supervising power, maintain
order in nature, continuity in change, ever-new life
evolved from incessant death, must be inherent tendencies
to combination, harmony, and organization,
and thus may account for the origin of the system
which they sustain and renew. This type of atheism
has its most authentic exposition in the <span class="tei tei-q">“De Rerum
Natura”</span> of Lucretius. He does not, in so many
words, deny the being of the gods,—he, indeed,
speaks of them as leading restful lives, withdrawn
from all care of mortal affairs; but he so scoffs at all
practical recognition of them, and so jeers at the reverence
and awe professed for them by the multitude,
that we are constrained to regard them as rather the
imagery of his verse than the objects of his faith.
He maintains the past eternity of matter, which
consists of atoms or monads of various forms. These,
drifting about in space, and impinging upon one another,
by a series of happy chances, fell into orderly
relations and close-fitting symmetries, whence, in succession,
and by a necessity inherent in the primitive
atoms, came organization, life, instinct, love, reason,
wisdom. This poem has a peculiar value at the
present day, as closely coincident in its cosmogony
with one of the most recent phases of physical philosophy,
and showing that what calls itself progress
may be motion in a circle.

magnificent paintings by Polygnotus, in which their
doctrines were first taught, owe their origin to Zeno,
who lived to a very great age, illustrious for self-control,
temperance, and the severest type of virtue, and
at length, in accordance with a favorite dogma and
practice of his school, when he found that he had before
him only growing infirmity with no hope of restoration,
terminated his life by his own hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to the Stoic philosophy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">virtue is the
sole end of life</span></span>, and virtue is the conformity of the
will and conduct to universal nature. Virtue alone is
good; vice alone is evil; and whatever is neither virtue
nor vice is neither good nor evil in itself, but is
to be sought or shunned, according as it is auxiliary
to virtue or conducive to vice,—if neither, to be regarded
with utter indifference. Virtue is indivisible.
It does not admit of degrees. He who only approximates
to virtue, however closely, is yet to be regarded
as outside of its pale. Only the wise man can be
virtuous. He needs no precepts of duty. His intuitions
are always to be trusted. His sense of right
cannot be blinded or misled. As for those who do
not occupy this high philosophic ground, though they
cannot be really virtuous, they yet may present some
show and semblance of virtue, and they may be
aided in this by precepts and ethical instruction.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was for the benefit of those who, on account of their
lack of true wisdom, needed such direction, and were
at the same time so well disposed as to receive and
follow it, that treatises on practical morality were
written by many of the later Stoics, and that in
Rome there were teachers of this school who exercised
functions closely analogous to those of the Christian
preacher and pastor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stoicism found <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">its most congenial soil</span></span> in the
stern, hardy integrity and patriotism of those Romans,
whose incorruptible virtue is the one redeeming
feature of the declining days of the Republic and the
effeminacy and coarse depravity of the Empire. Seneca's
ethical writings<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> are almost Christian, not only
in their faithful rebuke of every form of wrong, but
in their tender humanity for the poor, the slaves, the
victims of oppression, in their universal philanthropy,
and in their precepts of patience under suffering,
forbearance, forgiveness, and returning good for evil.
Epictetus, the deformed slave of a capricious and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cruel master, beaten and crippled in mere wantonness,
enfranchised in his latter years, only to be driven into
exile and to sound the lowest depths of poverty, exhibited
a type of heroic virtue which has hardly been
equalled, perhaps never transcended by a mere mortal;
and though looking, as has been already said, to
annihilation as the goal of life, he maintained a spirit
so joyous, and has left in his writings so attractive a
picture of a soul serenely and supremely happy, that
he has given support and consolation to multitudes of
the bravest and best disciples of the heaven-born religion,
which he can have known—if at all—only
through its slanderers and persecutors. Marcus Aurelius,
in a kindred spirit, and under the even heavier
burdens of a tottering empire, domestic dissensions,
and defeat and disaster abroad, maintained the severest
simplicity and purity of life, appropriated portions
of his busiest days to devout contemplation, meditated
constantly on death, and disciplined himself to
regard with contempt alike the praise of flatterers
and the contingency of posthumous fame. We have,
especially in Nero's reign, the record of not a few
men and women of like spirit and character, whose
lofty and impregnable virtue lacked only loving faith
and undoubting trust in a fatherly Providence to assimilate
them to the foremost among the Apostles and
martyrs of the Christian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The Sceptical school of philosophy</span></span> claims in this
connection a brief notice. Though so identified in
common speech with the name of a single philosopher,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that Pyrrhonism is a synonyme for Scepticism, it was
much older than Pyrrho, and greatly outnumbered
his avowed followers. It was held by the teachers of
this school that objective truth is unattainable. Not
only do the perceptions and conceptions of different
persons vary as to every object of knowledge; but
the perceptions and conceptions of the same persons
as to the same object vary at different times. Nay,
more, at the same time one sense conveys impressions
which another sense may negative, and not infrequently
the reflective faculty negatives all the impressions
derived from the senses, and forms a conception
entirely unlike that which would have taken
shape through the organs of sense. The soul that seeks
to know, is thus in constant agitation. But happiness
consists in imperturbableness of spirit, that is, in suspense
of judgment; and as it is our duty to promote
our own happiness, it is our duty to live without desire
or fear, preference or abhorrence, love or hatred,
in entire apathy,—a life of which Mohammed's fabled
coffin is the fittest symbol.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">New Academy</span></span>, whose philosophy was a hybrid
of Platonism and Pyrrhonism, while it denied the
possibility of ascertaining objective truth, yet taught
that on all subjects of speculative philosophy probability
is attainable, and that, if the subject in hand
be one which admits of being acted upon, it is the
duty of the moral agent to act in accordance with
probability,—to pursue the course in behalf of which
the more and the better reasons can be given. There
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are moral acts and habits which seem to be in accordance
with reason and the nature of things. We may
be mistaken in thinking them so; yet the probability
that they are so creates a moral obligation in their
favor. The New Academy professed a hypothetical
acquiescence in the ethics of the Peripatetic school,
maintaining, therefore, that the mean between two
extremes is probably in accordance with right and
duty, and that virtue is probably man's highest good,
yet probably not sufficient in itself without the addition
of exterior advantages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Cicero</span></span> considered himself as belonging to the New
Academy. His instincts as an advocate, often induced
by professional exigencies to deny what he had
previously affirmed, made the scepticism of this school
congenial to him; while his love of elegant ease and
luxury and his lack of moral courage were in closer
harmony with the practical ethics of the Peripatetics
than with the more rigid system of the Stoics. At
the same time, his pure moral taste and his sincere
reverence for the right brought him into sympathy
with the Stoic school. His <span class="tei tei-q">“De Officiis”</span> is an exposition
of the Stoic system of ethics, though by the
professed disciple of another philosophy. It is as if
a Mohammedan, without disclaiming his own religion,
should undertake an exposition of the ethics of Christianity,
on the ground that, though Mohammed was
a genuine prophet, there was, nevertheless, a higher
and purer morality in the New Testament than in
the Koran.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">For several centuries after the destruction of
the Western Empire</span></span>, philosophy had hardly an
existence except in its records, and these were preserved
chiefly for their parchment, half-effaced, covered
by what took the place of literature in the (so
called) Dark Ages, and at length deciphered by such
minute and wearisome toil as only mediæval cloisters
have ever furnished. For a long period, monasteries
were the only schools, and in these the learned men of
the day were, either successively or alternately, learners
and teachers, whence the appellation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schoolmen</span></span>.
The learned men who bear this name were
fond of casuistry, and discussed imagined and often
impossible cases with great pains (their readers would
have greater); but, so far as we know, they have left
no systematic treatises on moral philosophy, and have
transmitted no system that owes to them its distinguishing
features. Yet we find among them a very
broad division of opinion as to the ground of right.
The fundamental position of the Stoics, that virtue
is conformity to nature, and thus independent of express
legislation,—not created by law, human or
divine, but the source and origin of law,—had its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
champions, strong, but few; while the Augustinian
theology, then almost universal, replaced Epicureanism
in its denial of the intrinsic and indelible moral
qualities of actions. The extreme Augustinians regarded
the positive command of God as the sole cause
and ground of right, so that the very things which
are forbidden under the severest penalties would
become virtuous and commendable, if enjoined by
Divine authority. William of Ockham, one of the
most illustrious of the English Schoolmen, wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“If
God commanded his creatures to hate himself, the
hatred of God would be the duty of man.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">earliest modern</span></span> theory of morals that presented
striking peculiarities was that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Hobbes</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1588-1679), who was indebted solely to the
stress of his time, alike for his system and for whatever
slender following it may have had. He was from
childhood a staunch royalist, was shortly after leaving
the University the tutor of a loyal nobleman, and,
afterward, of Charles II. during the early years of his
exile; and the parliamentary and Puritan outrages
seemed to him to be aimed at all that was august and
reverend, and adapted to overturn society, revert
progress, and crush civilization. According to him,
men are by nature one another's enemies, and can be
restrained from internecine hostility only by force or
fear. An instinctive perception of this truth in the
infancy of society gave rise to monarchical and absolute
forms of government; for only by thus centralizing
and massing power, which could be directed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against any disturber of the peace, could the individual
members of society hold property or life in safety.
The king thus reigns by right of human necessity,
and obedience to him and to constituted authorities
under him is man's whole duty, and the sum of virtue.
Might creates right. Conscience is but another name
for the fear of punishment. The intimate connection
of religion with civil freedom in the English Commonwealth
no doubt went far in uprooting in Hobbes
all religious faith; and while he did not openly attack
Christianity, he maintained the duty of entire conformity
to the monarch's religion, whatever it might
be, which is of course tantamount to the denial of
objective religious truth.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hobbes may fairly be regarded as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the father of
modern ethical philosophy</span></span>,—not that he had children
after his own likeness; but his speculations were
so revolting equally to thinking and to serious men,
as to arouse inquiry and stimulate mental activity in
a department previously neglected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gauntlet thus thrown down by Hobbes was
taken up by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Cudworth</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1617-1688), the most
learned man of his time, whose <span class="tei tei-q">“Intellectual System
of the Universe”</span> is a prodigy of erudition,—a work
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in which his own thought is so blocked up with quotations,
authorities, and masses of recondite lore, that it
is hardly possible to trace the windings of the river for
the débris of auriferous rocks that obstruct its flow.
The treatise with which we are concerned is that
on <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternal and Immutable Morality.”</span> In this he
maintains that the right exists, independently of all
authority, by the very nature of things, in co-eternity
with the Supreme Being. So far is he from admitting
the possibility of any dissiliency between the
Divine will and absolute right, that he turns the tables
on his opponents, and classes among Atheists
those of his contemporaries who maintain that God
can command what is contrary to the intrinsic right;
that He has no inclination to the good of his creatures;
that He can justly doom an innocent being to
eternal torments; or that whatever God wills is just
because He wills it.

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1675-1729) followed Cudworth
in the same line of thought. He was, it is believed,
the first writer who employed the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fitness</span></span>
as defining the ground of the immutable and eternal
right, though the idea of fitness necessarily underlies
every system or theory that assigns to virtue intrinsic
validity.

as residing, not in the nature or relations of things,
but in the bearing of actions on the welfare or happiness
of beings other than the actor. Benevolence
constitutes virtue; and the merit of the action and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the actor is determined by the degree in which particular
affections are merged in general philanthropy,
and reference is had, not to individual beneficiaries or
benefits, but to the whole system of things of which
the actor forms a part. The affections from which
such acts spring commend themselves to the moral
sense, and are of necessity objects of esteem and
love. But the moral sense takes cognizance of the
affections only, not of the acts themselves; and as
the conventional standard of the desirable and the
useful varies with race, time, and culture, the acts
which the affections prompt, and which therefore are
virtuous, may be in one age or country such as the
people of another century or land may repudiate with
loathing. Las Casas, in introducing negro slavery
into America, with the fervently benevolent purpose
of relieving the hardships of the feeble and overtasked
aborigines, performed, according to this theory, a virtuous
act; but had he once considered the question of
intrinsic right or natural fitness, a name so worthily
honored would never have been associated with the
foulest crime of modern civilization.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Adam Smith</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1723-1790),
moral distinctions depend wholly on sympathy. We
approve in others what corresponds to our own tastes
and habits; we disapprove whatever is opposed to
them. As to our own conduct, <span class="tei tei-q">“we suppose ourselves,”</span>
he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“the spectators of our own behavior,
and endeavor to imagine what effect it would in
this light produce in us.”</span> Our sense of duty is derived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wholly from our thus putting ourselves in the
place of others, and inquiring what they would approve
in us. Conscience, then, is a collective and
corporate, not an individual faculty. It is created by
the prevalent opinions of the community. Solitary
virtue there cannot be; for without sympathy there
is no self-approval. By parity of reason, the duty of
the individual can never transcend the average conscience
of the community. This theory describes society
as it is, not as it ought to be. We are, to a sad
degree, conventional in our practice, much more so
than in our beliefs; but it is the part of true manliness
to have the conscience an interior, not an external
organ, to form and actualize notions of right and
duty for one's self, and to stand and walk alone, if
need there be, as there manifestly is in not a few critical
moments, and as there is not infrequently in the
inward experience of every man who means to do his
duty.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Butler</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1692-1752), in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Ethical Discourses,”</span>
aims mainly and successfully to demonstrate
the rightful supremacy of conscience. His favorite
conception is of the human being as himself a household
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">an economy</span></span>],—the various propensities, appetites,
passions, and affections, the members,—Conscience,
the head, recognized as such by all, so that
there is, when her sovereignty is owned, an inward
repose and satisfaction; when she is disobeyed, a sense
of discord and rebellion, of unrest and disturbance.
This is sound and indisputable, and it cannot be more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
clearly stated or more vividly illustrated than by Butler;
but he manifestly regards conscience as legislator
no less than judge, and thus fails to recognize any
objective standard of right. It is evident that on his
ground there is no criterion by which honestly erroneous
moral judgments can be revised, or by which a
discrimination can be made between the results of
education or involuntary prejudice, and the right as
determined by the nature of things and the standard
of intrinsic fitness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of all modern ethical writers since the time of
Cudworth and Clarke, none so much as approaches
the position occupied by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Richard Price</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1723-1791),
a London dissenting divine, a warm advocate
of American independence, and the intimate friend of
John Adams. He maintained that right and wrong
are inherent and necessary, immutable and eternal
characteristics, not dependent on will or command, but
on the intrinsic nature of the act, and determined with
unerring accuracy by conscience, whenever the nature
of the case is clearly known. <span class="tei tei-q">“Morality,”</span> he writes,
<span class="tei tei-q">“is fixed on an immovable basis, and appears not to be
in any sense factitious, or the arbitrary production of
any power, human or divine; but equally everlasting
and necessary with all truth and reason.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Virtue
is of intrinsic value and of indispensable obligation;
not the creature of will, but necessary and immutable;
not local and temporary, but of equal extent and antiquity
with the Divine mind; not dependent on
power, but the guide of all power.”</span><a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Paley</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1743-1805) gives a definition of virtue,
remarkable for its combination of three partial
theories. Virtue, according to him, is <span class="tei tei-q">“the doing
good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God,
and for the sake of everlasting happiness.”</span> Of this
definition it may be said, 1. The doing good to mankind
is indeed virtue; but it is by no means the whole
of virtue. 2. Obedience to the will of God is our
duty; but it is so, because his will must of necessity
be in accordance with the fitting and right. Could
we conceive of Omnipotence commanding what is intrinsically
unfit and wrong, the virtuous man would
not be the God-server, but the Prometheus suffering
the implacable vengeance of an unrighteous Deity.
3. Though everlasting happiness be the result of virtue,
it is not the ground or the reason for it. Were
our being earth-limited, virtue would lose none of its
obligation. Epictetus led as virtuous a life as if
heaven had been open to his faith and hope.—Paley's
system may be described in detail as Shaftesbury's,
with an external washing of Christianity;
Shaftesbury having been what was called a free-thinker,
while Paley was a sincere believer in the
Christian revelation, and contributed largely and efficiently
to the defence of Christianity and the illustration
of its records. The chief merit of Paley's
treatise on Moral Philosophy is that it clearly and
emphatically recognizes the Divine authority of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moral teachings of the New Testament, though in
expounding them the author too frequently dilutes
them by considerations of expediency.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Jeremy Bentham</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1747-1832)
is Paley <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">minus</span></span>
Christianity. The greatest good of the greatest
number is, according to him, the aim and criterion of
virtue. Moral rules should be constructed with this
sole end; and this should be the pervading purpose of
all legislation. Bentham's works are very voluminous,
and they cover, wisely and well, almost every
department of domestic, social, public, and national
life. The worst that can be said of his political writings
is that they are in advance of the age,—literally
Utopian;<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> for it would be well with the country
which was prepared to embody his views. But, unfortunately,
his principles have no power of self-realization.
They are like a watch, perfect in all other
parts, but without the mainspring. Bentham contemplates
the individual man as an agency, rather than
as an intellectual and moral integer. He must work
under yoke and harness for ends vast and remote,
beyond the appreciation of ordinary mortals; and he
must hold all partial affections and nearer aims subordinate
to rules deduced by sages and legislators from
considerations of general utility. Bentham's influence
on legislation, especially on criminal law, has
been beneficially felt on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the department of pure ethics, there are no essential
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
points of difference between him and other writers
of the utilitarian school.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">France</span></span> there has been a large preponderance of
sensualism, expediency, and selfishness in the ethical
systems that have had the most extensive currency.
There was a great deal of elaborate ethical speculation
and theory among the French philosophers of the
last century; but among them we cannot recall a
single writer who maintained a higher ground than
Bentham, except that Rousseau—perhaps the most
immoral of them all—who was an Epicurean so far
as he had any philosophy, sometimes soars in sentimental
rhapsodies about the intrinsic beauty and loveliness
of a virtue which he knew only by name.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Malebranche</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1638-1714), whose principal
writings belong to the previous century, represents
entirely opposite views and tendencies. He hardly
differs from Samuel Clarke, except in phraseology.
He resolves virtue into love of the universal order,
and conformity to it in conduct. This order requires
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that we should prize and love all beings and objects
in proportion to their relative worth, and that we
should recognize this relative worth in our rules and
habits of life. Thus man is to be more highly valued
and more assiduously served than the lower animals,
because worth more; and God is to be loved infinitely
more than man, and to be always obeyed and served
in preference to man, because he is worth immeasurably
more than the beings that derive their existence
from him. Malebranche ascribes to the Supreme
Being, not the arbitrary exercise of power in constituting
the right, but recognition, in his government
of the world and in his revealed will, of the order,
which is man's sole law. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sovereign princes,”</span> he
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“have no right to use their authority without
reason. Even God has no such miserable right.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At nearly the same period commenced the ethical
controversy between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Fénélon</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1651-1715) and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Bossuet</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 1627-1704),
as to the possibility and
obligation of disinterested virtue. Fénélon and the
Quietists, who sympathized with him, maintained
that the pure love of God, without any self-reference,
or regard for one's own well-being either here or here-after,
is the goal and the test of human perfection,
and that nothing below this—nothing which aims or
aspires at anything less than this—deserves the
name of virtue. Bossuet defended the selfish theory
of virtue, attacked his amiable antagonist with unconscionable
severity and bitterness, and succeeded in
obtaining from the court of Rome—though against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the wishes of the Pope—the condemnation of the
obnoxious tenet. The Pope remarked, with well-turned
antithesis, that Fénélon might have erred
from excess in the love of God, while Bossuet had
sinned by defect in the love of his neighbor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the recent French moralists, the most distinguished
names are those of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Jouffroy</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Cousin</span></span>,
who—each with a terminology of his own—agree
with Malebranche in regarding right and wrong as
inherent and essential characteristics of actions, and
as having their source and the ground of their validity
in the nature of things. The aim of Cousin's well-known
treatise on <span class="tei tei-q">“The True, the Beautiful, and the
Good,”</span> is purely ethical, and the work is designed to
identify the three members of the Platonic triad with
corresponding attributes of the Infinite Being,—attributes
which, virtually one, have their counterpart and
manifestation in the order of nature and the government
of the universe.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Germany</span></span>, the necessarian philosophers of the
Pantheistic school ignore ethics by making choice and
moral action impossible. Man has no distinct and
separate personality. He is for a little while detached
in appearance from the soul of the universe (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">anima
mundi</span></span>), but in reality no more detached from it than
is a boulder or a log of drift-wood from the surface on
which it rests. He still remains a part of the universal
soul, the multiform, all-embracing God, who is
himself not a self-conscious, freely willing being, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
impelled by necessity in all his parts and members,
and, no less than in all else, in those human members
through which alone he attains to some fragmentary
self-consciousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Kant</span></span>, the reason intuitively discerns
truths that are necessary, absolute, and universal.
The theoretical reason discerns such truths in the
realm of ontology, and in the relations and laws that
underlie all subjects of physical inquiry. In like
manner, the practical reason intuitively perceives the
conditions and laws inherent in the objects of moral
action,—that is, as Malebranche would have said, the
elements of universal order, or, in the language of
Clarke, the fitness of things. As the mind must of
necessity contemplate and cognize objects of thought
under the categories intuitively discerned by the theoretical
reason, so must the will be moved by the conditions
and laws intuitively discerned by the practical
reason. This intuition is law and obligation. Man
can obey it, and to obey it is virtue. He can disobey
it, and in so doing he does not yield to necessity, but
makes a voluntary choice of wrong and evil.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be perceived from the historical survey in
this and the previous chapter, that—as was said at
the outset—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">all ethical systems resolve themselves
into the two classes of which the Epicureans
and the Stoics furnished the pristine types,</span></span>—those
which make virtue an accident, a variable,
subject to authority, occasion, or circumstance; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those which endow it with an intrinsic right, immutableness,
validity, and supremacy. On subjects of
fundamental moment, opinion is of prime importance.
Conduct results from feeling, and feeling from opinion.
We would have the youth, from the very earliest
period of his moral agency, grounded in the belief
that right and wrong are immutable,—that they
have no localities, no meridians,—that, with a change
of surroundings, their conditions and laws vary as
little as do those of planetary or stellar motion. Let
him feel that right and wrong are not the mere dicta
of human teaching, nay, are not created even by revelation;
but let their immutable distinction express
itself to his consciousness in those sublime words
which belong to it, as personified in holy writ, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah
possessed me from the beginning of his way,
before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting,
from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When
He prepared the heavens, I was there. When He
appointed the foundations of the earth, then was I by
Him.”</span> This conception of the Divine and everlasting
sacredness of virtue, is a perennial fountain of
strength. He who has this does not imagine that he
has power over the Right, can sway it by his choice,
or vary its standard by his action; but it overmasters
him, and, by subduing, frees him, fills and energizes
his whole being, ennobles all his powers, exalts and
hallows all his affections, makes him a priest to God,
and a king among men.

duty of society to inflict capital punishment on the murderer has
been maintained on the ground of the Divine command to that effect, said
to have been given to Noah, and thus to be binding on all his posterity.
(Genesis ix. 5.) My own belief—founded on a careful examination of the
Hebrew text—is, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em> murderer is not referred
to in this precept, but that it simply requires the slaying of the beast that
should cause the death of a man,—a precaution which was liable to be neglected in
a rude state of society, and was among the special enactments of the Mosaic law.
(Exodus xxi. 38.) If, however, the common interpretation be retained,
the precept requires the shedding of the murderer's blood by the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">brother</span></span> or nearest kinsman of the murdered man, and is not
obeyed by giving up the murderer to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gallows</span></span> and the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">public executioner</span></span>. Moreover, the same series of precepts
prescribes an abstinence from the natural juices of animal
food, which would require an entire revolution in our shambles, kitchens,
and tables. If these precepts were Divine commandments for men of all
times, they should be obeyed in full; but there is the grossest inconsistency
and absurdity in holding only a portion of one of them sacred, and ignoring
all the rest.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_6" name="note_6" href="#noteref_6">6.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Latin,

as its only standard of right, is the law which he has elected for his
own administration of the universe. Could we conceive of omnipotence
not recognizing this law, the decrees and acts of such a being would not be

issue with regard to sabbatical observance hardly belong
to an elementary treatise on ethics. I ought not, however, to leave any
doubt as to my own opinion. I believe, then, the rest of the Sabbath a
necessity of man's constitution, physical and mental, of that of the beasts
subservient to his use, and, in some measure, even of the inanimate agents
under his control, while the sequestration of the day from the course of
ordinary life is equally a moral and religious necessity. The weekly Sabbath
I regard as a dictate of natural piety, and a primeval institution, re-enacted,
not established, by Moses, and sanctioned by our Saviour when
he refers to the Decalogue as a compend of moral duty, as also in various
other forms and ways. As to modes of sabbatical observance, the rigid
abstinences and austerities once common in New England were derived
from the Mosaic ceremonial law, and have no sanction either in the New
Testament or in the habits of the early Christians. I can conceive of no
better rule for the Lord's day, than that each person so spend it as to interfere
as little as possible with its fitting use by others, and to make it as
availing as he can for his own relaxation from secular cares, and growth
in wisdom and goodness.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_12" name="note_12" href="#noteref_12">12.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">It was the

Jesus forbids swearing by heaven, because <span class="tei tei-q">“it is God's throne,”</span>
and by the earth, because <span class="tei tei-q">“it is his footstool,”</span> the inference is obvious
that, for still stronger reasons, all direct swearing by God himself is prohibited.
The word μήτε, which introduces the oaths by inferior objects
specified in the text under discussion, not infrequently corresponds to our
phrase <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not even</span></span>. With this sense

I find that some writers on this subject quote in vindication of oaths on
solemn occasions the instances in the Scriptures in which God is said to
have sworn by Himself. The reply is obvious, that no being can swear by
himself, the essential significance of an oath being an appeal to some being
or object other than one's self. Because God <span class="tei tei-q">“can swear by no greater,”</span>
it is certain that when this phraseology is used concerning Him, it is employed
figuratively, to aid the poverty of human conceptions, and to express
the certainty of his promise by the strongest terms which human language
affords. In like manner, God is said by the sacred writers to repent
of intended retribution to evil-doers, not that infinite justice and love can
change in thought, plan, or purpose, but because a change of disposition
and feeling is wont to precede human clemency to evil-doers.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_14" name="note_14" href="#noteref_14">14.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The

he was in suspicious proximity to, if not in complicity with, gross
scandals and crimes, is equally certain. The evidence against him is
weighty, but by no means conclusive. He may have lingered in the purlieus
of the palace in fond memory of what Nero had been in the promise
of his youth, and in the groundless hope of bringing him again under
more humane influences. This supposition is rendered the more probable
by the well-known fact, that during his whole court life, and notwithstanding

who is conversant with the literature of ethics in England
and America will miss in this chapter many names which merit a place by
the side of those that have been given. But within the limits proposed
for this manual, the alternative was to select a few writers among those
who have largely influenced the thought of their own and succeeding
times, and to associate with each of them something that should mark his
individuality; or to make the chapter little more than a catalogue of names.
The former is evidently the more judicious course. Nothing has been said
of living writers,—not because there are none who deserve an honored
place among the contributors to this department of science, but because,
were the list to be once opened, we should hardly know where to close it.</dd></dl>
